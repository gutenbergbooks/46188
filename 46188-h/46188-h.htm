<h1>ELSIE'S YOUNG FOLKS.</h1>

<hr class="r5" />

<p class="ph2">CHAPTER I.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a lovely summer day, bright and clear,
but the heat so tempered&mdash;there on the coast
of Maine&mdash;by the delicious sea breeze that it
was delightful and exhilarating. The owner
and passengers of the <i>Dolphin</i> had forsaken
her more than a fortnight ago, and since spent
their days and nights at a lovely villa on shore
there in Bar Harbor; but now no longer able
to resist the attractions of the beautiful sea,
the most of them had come aboard, and were
sitting, standing, or roaming about the deck.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad to be in our own dear sea
home again!" cried Elsie Raymond. "Aren't
you, Ned?"</p>

<p>"Yes; though we have been having a splendid
time on shore in Bar Harbor."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, so we have; but as we expect to be
back again in a few days, we needn't fret at all
about leaving it."</p>

<p>"No, nor we needn't if we were just going
back to Woodburn, our own beautiful home&mdash;certainly
a better place than this in fall and
winter, anyhow."</p>

<p>"But I'm glad to have a sail again," said
Elsie.</p>

<p>"Brother Max says we'll soon see some
places where they had sea fights in our two
wars with England," remarked Ned, with satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Oh, does he? I mean to ask papa or
grandma to tell us about them," exclaimed
Elsie, in tones of excitement.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, let's!" cried Ned. "But the men
are taking up the anchor," he added hastily,
"and I must see that first. Come," catching
his sister's hand and hurrying her along to a
good position from which to view the operation.</p>

<p>That duly attended to, they sought out their
grandma, who happened to be at the moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
sitting a little apart from the others, and
made their request. She smilingly consented
to tell them all she could recall on the subject
that would be interesting to them, and bidding
them seat themselves close beside her she
began.</p>

<p>"Your father has told me that we are now
going out to the extreme eastern point of the
State&mdash;and of our country&mdash;the United States.
West Quoddy Head is its name now, but in
very early times it was called Nurumbega. In
1580 John Walken, in the service of Sir Humphrey
Gilbert, conducted an expedition to its
shores, and reached the Penobscot River. In
1603 two vessels, the <i>Speedwell</i> and the <i>Discoverer</i>,
entered the Penobscot Bay and the
mouth of a river&mdash;probably the Saco. About
three years after that two French Jesuits, with
several families, settled on Mount Desert
Island. A few years later some twenty-five
French colonists landed on Mount Desert and
founded a settlement called St. Saviour. But
not long afterward they were driven away by
some English under command of Captain Argal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
who considered them trespassers upon
English soil. That, I think, is enough of the
very early history of Maine, for to-day, at
least."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, grandma! but won't you please
tell about Revolutionary times and the war of
1812-14?" pleaded Elsie. "Maine was one of
the thirteen colonies, wasn't she?"</p>

<p>"No, dear; she was considered a part of
Massachusetts at that time, and did not become
a separate State until 1820."</p>

<p>"Oh, didn't the people there care about the
Revolution and help in it?" asked Elsie in a
tone of disappointment.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, they did. In a county convention
in 1774 Sheriff William Tyng declared
his intention to obey province law and not that
of parliament. He advised a firm and persevering
opposition to every design, dark or
open, framed to abridge our English liberties."</p>

<p>"English!" exclaimed Ned, in a half scornful
tone, at which his grandma smiled, and
stroking his curls caressingly, said, "Yes,
Neddie, at that time&mdash;before the Revolutionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
War&mdash;our people liked to call themselves
English."</p>

<p>"But we don't now, grandma; we're Americans."</p>

<p>"Yes; that is the name we have given ourselves
in these days; but we consider the English
our relations&mdash;a sort of cousins."</p>

<p>"Well, then I hope we and they will never
fight any more," said Elsie. "But, please,
grandma, tell us something more of what has
happened along this coast."</p>

<p>"In 1775," continued her grandma, "the
British kept the coast of New England from
Falmouth (now called Portland) to New London
in continual alarm; they were out in every
direction plundering the people to supply their
camp with provisions."</p>

<p>"In this State, grandma?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"Yes; and in Connecticut and Massachusetts.
They bombarded Stonington, in Connecticut,
shattered houses and killed two men.
That was in August or September. In October
Mowatt was sent to Falmouth in Maine
to get a supply of provisions from the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
there, and to demand a surrender of their
arms. They refused and defied him; then&mdash;after
giving time for the women and children
to leave the town&mdash;he bombarded and set it on
fire. More than four hundred houses were
destroyed&mdash;nearly all the town of about five
hundred buildings."</p>

<p>"What a cruel thing!" exclaimed Elsie; "I
suppose they had to give up then?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Travilla; "so brave and determined
were they that they repulsed the
marauders and would not let them land."</p>

<p>"Grandma," asked Elsie, "didn't Arnold
go through Maine with an army to attack
Canada about that time?"</p>

<p>"Yes; about the middle of August a committee
of Congress visited Washington in his
camp, and together they formed a plan to send
a force into Canada by way of the Kennebec
River to co-operate with General Schuyler,
who was preparing to invade that province by
way of the Northern lakes. Arnold was well
known to be brave. He had been complaining
of being ill-used upon Lake Champlain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Washington desired to silence his complaints,
and knowing that this expedition was suited to
his talents he appointed him to command, and
gave him the commission of colonel in the Continental
army.</p>

<p>"The force under his command consisted of
eleven hundred hardy men&mdash;ten companies of
musketeers from New England, and three
companies of riflemen from Virginia and Pennsylvania.
Those riflemen were commanded by
Captain Daniel Morgan, who afterward did
such good work for our country in her hard
struggle for liberty. Arnold and his troops
marched from Cambridge to Newburyport,
where they embarked on transports which
carried them to the mouth of the Kennebec.
They went up that river in bateaux and rendezvoused
at Fort Western, opposite the
present town of Augusta. Now they had
come to the edge of a vast and almost uninhabited
wilderness."</p>

<p>"And had to go through it, grandma?"
asked Ned.</p>

<p>"Yes; they were very brave men, ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
encounter difficulties and dangers for the
sake of securing their country's freedom. Two
small parties were sent on in advance to reconnoitre,
and the rest moved forward in four divisions,
Morgan with his riflemen in the van.
Arnold, who was the last, passed up the river
in a canoe."</p>

<p>"Hadn't they a very hard time going
through that wilderness, grandma?" asked
Elsie.</p>

<p>"Yes, very hard indeed; over craggy knolls,
deep ravines, through creeks and ponds and
deep morasses; sometimes paddling along a
stream in their canoes&mdash;sometimes carrying
them around a fall on their shoulders. Suddenly,
at length, they came to a mountain covered
with snow. At its foot they encamped
for three days. Then they went on again,
but a heavy rain set in, sending down such torrents
from the hills that the river rose eight
feet in one night. The water came roaring
down the valley where our soldiers were, so
unexpectedly and powerfully that they had
scarcely time to retreat and get into their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
bateaux before the whole plain was flooded
with water. Seven boats were overturned
and the provisions in them lost. Many of
them were made sick, too, by the storm and
exposure, and so grew sad and discouraged.
Some gave up and went back to their homes,
while Arnold went on with the rest. The rain
changed to snow, and there was ice in the
water in which the poor fellows had to wade
to push their bateaux along through ponds and
marshes near the sources of the Dead River.</p>

<p>"At last they reached Lake Megantic.
They encamped on its eastern shore, and the
next morning Arnold, with a party of fifty-five
men on shore with Captain Nanchet and thirteen
with himself in five bateaux and a birch
canoe, pushed on down the river to a French
settlement to get provisions to send back to his
almost starving men. They passed seventeen
falls, marching through snow two inches deep,
then reached the Highlands which separate the
waters of New England from Canada. But
as it is of the history of Maine I am telling
you, and Arnold and his band have now passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
out of it, we will leave the rest of his story for
another time."</p>

<p>"He did a good deal more for his country
before he turned traitor, didn't he, grandma?"
asked Elsie.</p>

<p>"Yes; he fought bravely again and again.
The great victory at Saratoga was largely due
to him; in a less degree to Morgan."</p>

<p>"Daniel Morgan who commanded at the
battle of the Cowpens?" asked Elsie.</p>

<p>"The very same," replied Mrs. Travilla.</p>

<p>"Didn't some other things happen along
this coast, grandma?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed; several things. In the war
of 1812-14 there occurred a naval battle near
Portland, between the American ship <i>Enterprise</i>
and the English brig <i>Boxer</i>. On the
morning of the 1st of September, 1813, the
<i>Enterprise</i> sailed from Portsmouth, New
Hampshire, and on the morning of the 3d
chased a schooner suspected of being a British
privateer, into Portland harbor. The next
day she left that harbor and steered eastward
looking for British cruisers. On the 5th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
they discovered in a bay what Captain Burrows
supposed to be a vessel of war getting
under way. She was a British brig, and on
sighting the <i>Enterprise</i> she displayed four
British ensigns, fired several guns as signals to
boats that had been sent ashore to return, and
crowding canvas, bore down gallantly for the
<i>Enterprise</i>.</p>

<p>"Seeing that, Burrows cleared his ship for
action, sailed out a proper distance from land
to have plenty of sea room for the fight, then
shortened sail and edged toward the <i>Boxer</i>.
That was at three o'clock in the afternoon.
Twenty minutes later the two brigs closed
within half pistol shot, and both opened fire at
the same time. The sea was almost quiet,
there was but little wind, and that condition of
things made the cannonading very destructive.
Ten minutes after the firing began the <i>Enterprise</i>
ranged ahead of the <i>Boxer</i>, steered across
her bows and delivered her fire with such precision
and destructive energy that at four
o'clock the British officer in command shouted
through his trumpet that he had surrendered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
but his flag being nailed to the mast, could
not be lowered until the <i>Enterprise</i> should
cease firing."</p>

<p>"And did she, grandma?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"Yes; I do not think our men ever fired on
a foe whom they believed to be ready to surrender.
Captain Blyth of the <i>Boxer</i> was already
dead, having been nearly cut in two by
an eighteen-pound ball, and Captain Burrows
was mortally wounded. He had been helping
the men to run out a carronade, and while
doing so a shot, supposed to be a canister
ball, struck his thigh, causing a fatal
wound. He lived eight hours, and must have
suffered terrible agony. He refused to be
carried below until the sword of the commander
of the <i>Boxer</i> should be brought to him.
He took it eagerly when brought, saying,
'Now I am satisfied; I die contented.'"</p>

<p>"What did they do for a commander after
their captain was so dreadfully injured?"
asked Elsie.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Edward R. M'Call took command
of the <i>Enterprise</i> and showed great skill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and courage," replied Grandma Elsie. "On
the morning of the 7th he took both vessels
into Portland Harbor, and the next day
the bodies of the two commanders were buried
side by side in the same cemetery, and with all
the honors to which their rank and powers entitled
them."</p>

<p>"Were the ships quite spoiled, grandma?"
asked Ned.</p>

<p>"The <i>Enterprise</i> was not, but the <i>Boxer</i>
was much cut up in both hull and rigging,"
she replied. "The battle showed that the
Americans exceeded the English in both nautical
skill and marksmanship. Lossing tells us
that a London paper, speaking of the battle,
said, 'The fact seems to be but too clearly
established that the Americans have some superior
mode of firing, and we cannot be too
anxiously employed in discovering to what circumstances
that superiority is owing.'"</p>

<p>"I think the man who wrote that was feeling
mortified that one of their vessels had
been whipped by one of ours," remarked Ned
sagely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Grandma Elsie, "I think the
nailing of their flag to the mast showed that
they felt confident of victory. Cooper tells in
his history that when the <i>Enterprise</i> hailed to
know if the <i>Boxer</i> had struck&mdash;as she kept her
flag flying&mdash;one of the officers of the British
vessel leaped upon a gun, shook both fists at
the Americans, and shouted 'No, no, no!'
adding some opprobrious epithets."</p>

<p>"Oh, didn't that make our fellows angry?"
asked Ned.</p>

<p>"I think not," replied Grandma Elsie; "it
seems to have amused them, as they saw that
he was ordered down by his superiors."</p>

<p>"Was it a long fight, grandma?" asked
Elsie.</p>

<p>"It had lasted only thirty-five minutes when
the <i>Boxer</i> surrendered."</p>

<p>"Had a great many of her men been
killed?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied his grandma, "but
on the <i>Enterprise</i> there was but one besides
Burrows; Midshipman Kervin Waters, who
had been mortally wounded, died a few weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
later. He was buried by the side of his gallant
leader&mdash;Burrows."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" sighed little Elsie, "war is so
dreadful!"</p>

<p>"It is indeed," said her grandma, "and it
was made especially dreadful at that time to
the people of this country by reason of our
being so much weaker than England in men,
money, and ships."</p>

<p>"But it was a blessing that our seamen were
so much more skilful than hers, Grandma
Elsie," said Max, who had drawn near in time
to hear the last few sentences. "Our little
navy did good work in that war, small as she
was in comparison with the enemy's. We had
but twenty ships to her thousand, yet showed
ourselves strong enough to put an end to her
tyrannical conduct toward our poor sailors.
She has never interfered again in that way
with them."</p>

<p>"And never will, I think," added Grandma
Elsie. "The two Anglo-Saxon nations are
good friends now, and I trust always will be."</p>

<p>"I hope so indeed," said Max. "We must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
be prepared for war, but I hope may be long
able to maintain peace with all other nations."</p>

<p>"A hope in which we can all join, I think,"
said Mrs. Travilla, glancing around upon the
circle of interested faces; for all the <i>Dolphin's</i>
passengers had by this time gathered about
them.</p>

<p>"You were talking of the war of 1812, were
you, mother?" asked Captain Raymond.</p>

<p>"Yes; I was telling the children of the fight
between the <i>Boxer</i> and the <i>Enterprise</i>," replied
Mrs. Travilla.</p>

<p>"And oh, won't you tell us some more,
grandma?" entreated Ned.</p>

<p>"I think your father could do it better," she
said, looking persuasively at the captain.</p>

<p>"I am not at all sure of that," he said;
"but if you wish it I will tell what I can remember
of such occurrences at the points
along the coast which we are about to visit.
But first let me beg that every one will feel
free to leave the vicinity should my story seem
to them dull and prosy," he added, with a smiling
glance about upon the little company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a moment's pause; then Violet
said laughingly, "That was very kind and
thoughtful my dear, and I for one shall not
hesitate to go should I feel inclined."</p>

<p>The captain responded with a bow and smile;
then, after a moment's pause, began upon the
chosen theme.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Eastport</span>&mdash;which we will presently visit,"
began Captain Raymond, "is on Moose Island,
in Passamaquoddy Bay. At the time of our
last war with them the English claimed it as
belonging to New Brunswick, under the treaty
of 1783. Early in July, 1814, Sir Thomas
Hardy sailed secretly from Halifax for that
place, with quite a force of men for land and
sea service. On the 11th the squadron entered
Passamaquoddy Bay and anchored off
Fort Sullivan, at Eastport. Major Perley
Putnam was in command of the fort, with a
garrison of fifty men and six pieces of artillery.
Hardy demanded an instant surrender, and
gave only five minutes' time for consideration.
Putnam promptly refused to surrender&mdash;but
the inhabitants of the island were greatly
alarmed and not disposed to resist, so entreated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
him to yield, which he did on condition that
private property should be respected.</p>

<p>"When the agreement was signed, the British
took possession of the fort, the town of
Eastport, and all the islands and villages in
and around Passamaquoddy Bay, landing a
thousand armed men, with women and children,
fifty or sixty pieces of cannon, and a battalion
of artillery."</p>

<p>"And did they stay there, papa?" asked
Elsie. "Oh, I hope they are not there now!"</p>

<p>"I have no doubt that nearly, if not all of
them, are in their graves by this time, daughter,"
replied the captain; then went on: "The
British made declaration that these islands
were in their permanent possession, and ordered
all the inhabitants to take an oath of
allegiance within seven days, or leave the territory."</p>

<p>"Allegiance to the King of England,
papa?" asked Elsie; "and did any of them
do it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is what was meant, and about
two-thirds of the people took it. They, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
English, took all the public property from the
custom-house, and tried to force the collector
to sign unfinished treasury notes to the value
of nine thousand dollars. But he refused, saying,
'Hanging will be no compulsion.'"</p>

<p>"Did that mean that he wouldn't do it even
if he knew they would hang him if he refused?"
asked Elsie.</p>

<p>"Yes, that was just it," said her father.
"Having accomplished what he wished to do
at Eastport&mdash;securing it to his country, as he
thought&mdash;leaving eight hundred troops to hold
it, Hardy sailed away along the coast of
Maine and Massachusetts, spreading alarm as
he went. But the people prepared to meet his
expected attack&mdash;manning their forts and arming
them. When Sherbrook and Griffith
sailed, they intended to stop at Machias and
take possession of it; but falling in with the
brig <i>Rifleman</i>, and being told by its commander
that the United States corvette <i>John Adams</i>
had gone up the Penobscot, they made haste to
the mouth of that river to blockade her.
They passed up the Green Island channel and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
entered the fine harbor of Castine on the
morning of the 1st of September. On the
edge of the water south of the village was the
half moon redoubt called Fort Porter, armed
with four twenty-pounders and two fieldpieces,
and manned by about forty men under
Lieutenant Lewis, of the United States army.
At sunrise Lewis was called upon to surrender.
He saw that resistance would be impossible,
so resolved to flee. He gave the enemy a volley
from his twenty-pounders, then spiked
them, blew up the redoubt, and with the fieldpieces
he and the garrison fled over the high
peninsula to its neck and escaped up the
Penobscot. Then the British took possession
of the town and control of the bay.</p>

<p>"The <i>John Adams</i> had just come home from
a successful cruise, and coming into Penobscot
Bay in a thick fog had struck a rock and received
so much injury that it was found necessary
to lay her up for repairs. They did their
best to take her out of harm's way, but it was
with difficulty they could keep her afloat until
she reached Hampden, a few miles below Bangor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Some of her crew were disabled by sickness,
and so she was almost helpless.</p>

<p>"Sherbrook, the commanding officer of the
British vessels, was told all this as soon as he
landed at Castine, and he and Griffith, commander
of the fleet, at once sent a land and
naval force to seize and destroy the <i>John
Adams</i>. The expedition sailed in the afternoon
of the day of the arrival at Castine.
The people along the Penobscot were not at
all inclined to submit to the British if they
could possibly escape doing so. On the day
the British sailed up the river word was sent
by express to Captain Morris, and he at once
communicated with Brigadier-General John
Blake, at his home in Brower, opposite Bangor,
asking him to call out the militia immediately.
Blake lost no time in assembling the tenth
Massachusetts division, of which he was commander.
That evening he rode down to
Hampden, where he found Captain Morris
busy with his preparations for defence. He
had taken the heavy guns of his ship to the
high right bank of the Soadabscook, fifty rods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
from the wharf, and placed them in battery
there so as to command the river approaches
from below.</p>

<p>"The next morning he and Blake held a consultation
on the best methods of defence, citizens
of Bangor and Hampden taking part in it.
Captain Morris had little confidence in the
militia, but expressed his intention to meet the
enemy at their landing-place, wherever that
might be, and also his resolution to destroy
the <i>Adams</i> rather than allow it to fall into
their hands.</p>

<p>"Belfast was taken the next morning by
General Gosselin, at the head of six hundred
troops. At the same time another detachment
marched up the western side of the
Penobscot unmolested, and reached Bald Hill
Cove at five o'clock in the evening. The
troops and eighty marines bivouacked there
that night in a drenching rain. During that
day about six hundred raw militia, who had
never seen anything more like war than their
own annual parade, had gathered at Hampden
and been posted by General Blake in an admirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
position on the brow of a hill. Lieutenant
Lewis and the forty men who had fled
from Castine had joined him. The artillery
company of Blake's brigade was there also,
with two brass three-pounders, and an iron
eighteen-pound carronade from the <i>Adams</i>
was placed in battery in the road near the
meeting-house in charge of Mr. Bent of the
artillery. Many of the militia were without
weapons or ammunition, but Captain Morris
supplied them as far as he could.</p>

<p>"While these arrangements were being made
Captain Morris had mounted nine short
eighteen-pounders from the <i>Adams</i> upon the
high bank over Crosby's wharf, and placed
them in charge of his first lieutenant, assisted
by the other two. With the rest of his guns
he took his position on the wharf, with about
two hundred seamen and marines and twenty
invalids, ready to defend his crippled ship to
the last extremity.</p>

<p>"The next morning all that region was covered
by a dense fog. The different British
detachments joined together, and by five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
o'clock were moving on toward Hampden&mdash;moving
cautiously in the mist, with a vanguard
of riflemen, and on the flanks detachments of
sailors and marines with a six-pound cannon,
a six and a half inch howitzer, and a rocket
apparatus. The British vessels at the same
time moved slowly up the river within supporting
distance.</p>

<p>"Blake had sent out two flank companies to
watch and annoy the approaching foe, and between
seven and eight o'clock they reported
them as coming up the hill to attack the
Americans. The fog was so thick that they
could not be seen, but Blake pointed his
eighteen-pounder in that direction, his fieldpieces
also, and fired away with a good deal of
effect, as he learned afterward; but the fog was
too thick for him to see it at the time. His
plan was to reserve his musket firing until the
enemy should be near enough to be seriously
hurt; but his men, being raw militia and without
the protection of a breastwork in front,
lost courage while standing there awaiting the
approach of the enemy, and when it came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
suddenly into view, marching at double-quick
and firing volleys in rapid succession, they were
panic-stricken, broke ranks, and fled in every
direction, leaving Blake and his officers alone.
Lieutenant Wadsworth saw it all from the
upper battery where he was, and sent word
immediately to Morris, who was on the wharf.</p>

<p>"The flight of the militia had left Morris'
rear and flank exposed, and he saw that it
would be impossible to defend himself against
such a force as was about to attack him.
He therefore ordered Wadsworth to spike
his guns and retreat with his men across
the bridge over the Soadabscook, while it was
yet open, for the stream was fordable only at
low water, and the tide was rising.</p>

<p>"Wadsworth obeyed, his rear gallantly covered
by Lieutenant Watson with some marines.
At the same time the guns on the wharf were
spiked, the <i>John Adams</i> was set on fire, and
Morris' men retreated across the Soadabscook,
he being the last man to leave the wharf.
Before he reached the bridge the British were
on the bank above him; but he dashed across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the stream, armpit deep in the water, and
under a galling fire from their muskets, unhurt,
joined his friends on the other side&mdash;Blake
and his officers and a mere remnant of
his command among them&mdash;and all retreated
to Bangor. Morris did not stay there, however,
but soon made his way overland to Portland."</p>

<p>"Did the British harm the people in that
town, papa?" asked Elsie.</p>

<p>"They took possession, and there was no
further resistance," replied the captain.
"Then they sent some vessels, with about five
hundred men, to Bangor. A mile from the
town they were met by a flag of truce from the
magistrates, who asked terms of capitulation.
The answer was that private property would
be respected. It was about ten o'clock when
they reached the town, and Commodore Barrie
gave notice that if the people would cheerfully
send in the required supplies they should not
be harmed in person or property. But he had
hardly done so before he gave his sailors to
understand that they might plunder as much
as they pleased."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"And did they, papa?" asked Elsie.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "history tells us that almost
every store on the western side of the
creek, which there empties into the Penobscot,
was robbed of all valuable property. Colonel
John, however, did all he could to protect
the inhabitants. The British forced the
people to surrender all their arms, military
stores, and public property of every kind, and
to report themselves prisoners of war for
parole, with a promise that they would not take
up arms against the British.</p>

<p>"Having robbed the people of property
worth twenty-three thousand dollars, destroyed,
by burning, fourteen vessels, and stolen
six, which they carried away with them, they
left Bangor for Hampden, which they treated
in the same way. There they desolated the
church&mdash;tearing up the Bible and psalm-books,
and demolishing the pulpit and pews. Lossing
tells us that the total loss of property at Hampden,
exclusive of the cargo of the <i>Commodore
Decatur</i>, was estimated at forty-four thousand
dollars. And in a note he adds that Williamson's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
'History of Maine' says, 'In the midst
of the rapine a committee waited on Barrie,
and told him that the people expected at his
hands the common safeguards of humanity, if
nothing more; to which the brutal officer replied,
"I have none for you. My business is to
burn, sink, and destroy. Your town is taken
by storm, and by the rules of war we ought to
both lay your village in ashes and put its inhabitants
to the sword. But I will spare your
lives, though I don't mean to spare your
houses."'"</p>

<p>"Oh, what a cruel wretch!" said Evelyn.</p>

<p>"A perfect savage, I should call him!" exclaimed
Lucilla hotly.</p>

<p>"I entirely agree with you, ladies," said Mr.
Lilburn, "and am sorry indeed to have to own
him as a countryman of mine."</p>

<p>"Well, Cousin Ronald," returned Mrs. Travilla
pleasantly, "there are plenty of Americans
of such character that I should be loth
indeed to own them as relatives."</p>

<p>"And there were plenty such in the days
of our two wars with England, as any one must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
acknowledge, remembering the lawless bands
of marauders called Cowboys and Skinners,"
said Violet; "they were more detestable than
the British themselves&mdash;even such as that
Barrie, Tarleton, and others too numerous to
mention."</p>

<p>"Will they ever come here again, papa?"
asked Ned.</p>

<p>"I think not, son," replied the captain;
"most, if not all of them, are now dead."</p>

<p>"Yes, it must have been a long, long while
ago," remarked the little lad reflectively.</p>

<p>"We are going now to Passamaquoddy Bay,
aren't we, papa?" asked Elsie.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "and hope to reach there
early this afternoon."</p>

<p>"And I hope we will see all that Lossing
tells about," said Grace.</p>

<p>"I think you may feel reasonably certain of
that," her father responded, in his kindly,
pleasant tones.</p>

<p>"We pass Machias on the way to Passamaquoddy
Bay, don't we, father?" asked Grace.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, "we are nearing it now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I remember something about what
occurred there in the Revolution; but won't
you please tell us the story again?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I will," he said. "We had then an exposed
coast many miles in extent, and not a
single armed vessel to protect it, while Britain
was the first naval power of the world. A few
of our planters and merchants had been trained
in the royal navy, and so had a good many
American seamen, to some extent, in helping
England in her wars with the French in the
twenty years preceding our Revolution; but
our wise men who were directing public affairs
could see no material for organizing a marine
force, so devoted themselves to the business of
raising an army. Immediately after the battle
of Lexington the British began depredations
along the New England coast, and soon
private vessels were gotten out by patriot
volunteers, who armed them as well as they
could, and did their best to defend the
coast.</p>

<p>"You know news did not fly so fast in those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
days as it does now, but when at length the
people of Machias heard of the affair at Lexington
it of course caused great excitement,
and a desire to defend their country against
the foe. There in their own harbor lay a
British armed schooner called the <i>Margaretta</i>.
She had two sloops with her, and the three
were busied in getting lumber for the British
army in Boston. A party of the young men
of the town determined to try to capture her
while her officers were at church on shore.
They seized one of the sloops, chased the
schooner out of the harbor, and after a severe
fight compelled her to surrender.</p>

<p>"It was the first naval engagement of the
Revolution. There were forty of the Americans,
commanded by Jeremiah O'Brien, and
about twenty of them, and as many of the
British, were killed in the fight. The captain
of the cutter was one of the mortally wounded.
Soon afterward O'Brien captured two small
English cruisers, making their crews prisoners,
and carrying them to Watertown, where the
Provincial Congress of Massachusetts was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
session. That body then took measures to
establish a coast marine to intercept English
transports bringing supplies for the British
troops, and gave O'Brien employment in that
service, with a captain's commission.</p>

<p>"The British force under Sherwood and
Griffiths, after their raid up the Penobscot,
went back to Machias. They landed at Buck's
Harbor, three miles below the town, and
marched against the fort, which the garrison
deserted and blew up."</p>

<p>"Are we going to Machias now, papa?"
asked Ned.</p>

<p>"No," said his father, "we are nearing
Passamaquoddy Bay now. We will spend a
little time there, then turn and go back to
the Penobscot, to visit historical scenes along
its course. You perhaps remember that the
British went there shortly after having taken
Eastport and Fort Sullivan on Moose Island
in Passamaquoddy Bay. They were taken on
the 11th of July, 1812; Castine on September
1 of the same year."</p>

<p>"And about a year after came the fight between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the <i>Enterprise</i> and the <i>Boxer</i>, which
occurred September 5, 1813," observed
Max.</p>

<p>"Yes," said his father, with a smile, "and of
course you remember the notable victory
vouchsafed us by Providence five days later on
Lake Erie?"</p>

<p>"Perry's victory, sir? Yes, indeed! Also
Macdonough's on Lake Champlain, which was
given him on the 11th of the next September,
1814."</p>

<p>But they were now entering the bay, and
historical reminiscence gave place to talk of
the beauty of the scenery, Captain Raymond,
who had been there before, pointing out and
naming the different islands and villages.
They did not land, but steamed slowly about
the bay, finding so much to interest them that
they lingered there until nightfall. They
then steamed out into the ocean, taking a
westward course. It was a beautiful moonlight
evening, and all gathering together on
deck, passed the time in cheerful chat concerning
the scenes just visited and those they expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
to visit in the near future. At length
there was a pause in the conversation, presently
broken by little Ned.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" he sighed, "I'm just hungry
for a little fun. I don't see what's the use of
having ventriloquists along, if they don't make
some fun for us once in a while."</p>

<p>"Now, Master Ned, do you call that a polite
speech?" asked a strange voice that seemed
to come from a short distance in his rear.</p>

<p>Ned sprang to his feet and turned toward
it.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I didn't mean to be rude, Cousin Ronald
or Brother Max, whichever you are; but I am
ever so hungry for a bit of fun."</p>

<p>"And you consider that a healthful appetite,
do you?" queried the voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; for 'Laugh and grow fat' is an
old saying, so I've heard."</p>

<p>"Well, well, well! I have understood that
you rather objected to being considered fat,"
laughed the invisible speaker.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I don't believe a bit of fun once
in a while would do much harm in that way,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
returned the little fellow. "At any rate, I'm
more than willing to try it."</p>

<p>"Well, suppose we try it with the understanding
that if you get too fat you are to be
reduced to your present suitable size by a low
and spare diet?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" cried Ned. "I won't consent
to that. Don't you know that boys need
to eat plenty, if they are to grow up into big,
strong men?"</p>

<p>"Enough, but not too much, Neddie,"
laughed his cousin, Dr. Percival, sitting near.</p>

<p>"Uncle Harold, you know all about it, for
you're a good doctor," said Ned, appealing to
Dr. Travilla; "oughtn't little boys to have
plenty to eat?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Ned; plenty, but not too much."</p>

<p>"Well, that's just what I want," laughed
Ned. "Oh, what was that?" as a cry, "Help!
help, or I shall drown!" came from the water
not far from the side of the vessel. Cousin
Ronald and Max exchanged inquiring glances,
and the latter rose hastily to his feet.</p>

<p>"Throw him a rope, my men!" he called to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
a group of sailors at the farther end of the vessel.</p>

<p>The words had hardly left his lips ere the
order was obeyed, and the next moment the
dripping figure of a young lad in a bathing suit
was drawn up and landed upon the deck.</p>

<p>"Thanks, thanks, gentlemen," he panted;
"you've helped me to a narrow escape from a
watery grave. I ventured out too far&mdash;alone
in the moonlight and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't try to talk, my man; you are too
much exhausted," interrupted Dr. Travilla,
for he, Captain Raymond, Max, Mr. Lilburn,
Chester, and Dr. Percival had all hurried to
the spot to see and assist the rescued stranger.</p>

<p>"Thanks! I'll do," he said, "if you'll kindly
help me to rub down, and lend me some things
till these can be made dry."</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Captain Raymond, and
at once gave directions that the stranger be
taken to a comfortably warm stateroom, provided
with everything needful, and his wet
garments dried and returned to him as quickly
as possible. Then turning to his brother-in-law,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
"I leave the rest to your care, Harold,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, Brother Max," cried Ned, as the gentlemen
rejoined the ladies and children, "I
thought it was you or Cousin Ronald calling
for help just for fun, and it was a real drowning
man, after all."</p>

<p>"A mere lad, Ned, and I am very glad we
were able to give him help in season."</p>

<p>The incident had created quite a little excitement,
and all eagerly awaited Harold's report.
He rejoined them in a few minutes,
looking so undisturbed that they at once felt
that his new patient was in no danger.</p>

<p>"He will be all right presently," he said, in
answer to their eagerly inquiring looks and
questions. "When we heard his cry for help
he had hardly more than just realized his danger.
He is somewhat ashamed of his venturesomeness,
and anxious to get back to his
friends without letting them know of the peril
he was in."</p>

<p>Turning to Captain Raymond, "He will be
very glad and grateful if you will go a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
out of your way and land him at the spot
where he entered the water, so that he may be
able to steal up to the house of his friends
without arousing their suspicions concerning
the danger he has been in."</p>

<p>"I think we may do that," the captain said,
in his kindly tones. "It will probably not delay
us more than an hour or so, and we are not
so hurried for time that we need decline to
submit to that."</p>

<p>Max at once gave the necessary orders, the
course of the vessel was changed, and ere long
the young stranger was landed at the spot
where he had entered the water. Then the
<i>Dolphin</i> proceeded on her westward way, and
when her passengers awoke in the morning
they were nearing Penobscot Bay.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">All</span> were eager to visit the historical places
immediately upon their arrival. As they entered
the harbor of Castine Mrs. Travilla remarked
that it was quite as picturesque as she
expected from Lossing's description.</p>

<p>"Ah, I entirely agree with you, Cousin
Elsie," responded Mr. Lilburn; "it is so bonny
a place that I do not wonder it was coveted by
the enemy."</p>

<p>The whole party presently landed, a guide
was found who promised to conduct them to
all the points of historical interest, and they
set out upon their search. They very much
admired the situation of the town, and the
view from it of the bay, with its picturesque
islands. They visited old Fort George,
built by the British in 1779, in the centre of
the peninsula, and repaired, fraised, and armed
by them in 1814. It was only a ruin now, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
interesting because of what it had been in
those earlier days. The view from its banks,
which were about eighteen feet high from the
bottom of the six feet deep ditch, was very
interesting. Looking northwestward from the
fort they could see on the right the entrance
to the canal cut by the British across Castine
Neck, turning the peninsula into an island.
It was about eighty rods long and twelve feet
deep, and now had a bridge across it. Between
the promontory and an island could be
seen the mouth of the Penobscot River. On
the extreme left they could see the town of Belfast,
thirteen miles distant. Leaving that
point they visited the remains of several other
forts built by the British, after which they returned
to the yacht for the evening meal and
the night's rest.</p>

<p>The <i>Dolphin</i> was allowed to remain stationary
until all her passengers were on deck
again the next morning; then the anchor was
lifted, and she steamed up the river. Favored
with delightful weather they greatly enjoyed
the trip up the beautiful, winding stream.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
They had taken on board a man well acquainted
with the river and every point of
interest upon its banks, and who pointed out
each one as they neared it. As they entered
Marsh Bay the young people were told that the
British squadron lay there one night on their
way toward Hampden. Elsie and Ned showed
keen interest when told of it, and in hearing
from their father of the cannon-ball of the
British that lodged in a storehouse there in
1814.</p>

<p>"Do you remember the story Lossing tells
about a Norway pine somewhere in this
region?" asked Mrs. Travilla, addressing
Captain Raymond.</p>

<p>"Something of it," he said, with an amused
smile, and the children at once begged to hear
it.</p>

<p>"Will you gratify them, mother?" asked the
captain. "You probably have a better recollection
of his story than I."</p>

<p>"I will do my best," she said, and began at
once. "Lossing says the tree was about a
mile above here, and the only one of its kind in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
that region&mdash;a round, compact tree, its short
trunk looking as if composed of a group of
smaller ones, and the limbs growing so near
the ground that it was difficult to get under it.
At the time that the British landed at Frankford
some man who had a large quantity of
bacon, being afraid they would rob him of it,
carried it to that tree and hung the pieces in
among the branches to hide them from the
foe; and though the British passed along the
road only a short distance from the tree, they
did not notice its peculiar fruit, so did not
meddle with it, and his bacon was saved; always
afterward that Norway pine was called
the Bacon Tree."</p>

<p>"Thank you, grandma; that was a nice
story," said Elsie.</p>

<p>"Haven't you another little story for
us, grandma?" asked Ned, in coaxing tones.
"I do always like your stories ever so
much."</p>

<p>At that Grandma Elsie laughed a pleasant
little laugh, then went on:</p>

<p>"Lossing tells us quite an interesting little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
story of a remarkable black man whom he
visited somewhere near here. His name was
Henry Van Meter, and he was then ninety-five
years old. During the Revolution he was
a slave to Governor Nelson of Virginia. After
that he became a seaman, and was one of the
crew of the privateer <i>Lawrence</i>, which sailed
from Baltimore in 1814. I suppose Lossing
questioned him about his long life, and heard
his story of it. He remembered having seen
Washington many times. The estate of Governor
Nelson, his first master, was sold after
the war, to pay his debts, and Henry was
bought by a planter beyond the Blue Ridge.
The new master wanted him to marry one of
his slave girls, and told him if he did he would
order in his will that he should be made a free
man at his (the master's) death. In telling of
it Henry said, 'I didn't like the gals, and didn't
want to wait for dead men's shoes. So master
sold me to a man near Lexington, Kentucky,
and there was only one log house in that town
when I went there.'</p>

<p>"He was soon sold to another man, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
treated him shamefully, and one night he
mounted one of his master's horses and fled to
the Kentucky River, where he turned the
horse loose, and told him to go home if he had
a mind to, as he didn't want to steal him.
Some kind white people helped Henry over
the river into Ohio, and at Cincinnati he then
took the name of Van Meter&mdash;the family
name of some of the Shenandoah Valley people
who had been kind to him.</p>

<p>"Afterward Henry became the servant of an
officer in the army of General St. Clair, and
served with our troops in the Northwest
under General Wayne. After that he lived in
Chillicothe, then came East to Philadelphia.
There some Quaker sent him to school, and he
learned to read and write. He became a sailor,
went to Europe several times in that capacity,
and when the war broke out he shipped as
such on board the privateer <i>Lawrence</i>. It
was taken by the British, and he was thrown
into Dartmoor Prison, and saw the massacre
there in 1815."</p>

<p>"Oh, what was that, grandma?" asked Ned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
in tones of excitement. "I didn't think I ever
heard about it."</p>

<p>"Lossing tells us," replied his grandmother,
"that Dartmoor was a depot for prisoners in
England; that it was situated in a desolate
region, was built in 1809 for a place in which
to confine French prisoners. At the time the
treaty of peace was made with us there were
six thousand American prisoners in it&mdash;two
thousand five hundred of them American seamen,
put there for refusing to fight in the
British Navy against their countrymen. They
were there when the war began in 1812. For
some unknown reason there was great delay in
setting those prisoners free after the treaty of
peace was made. It was nearly three months
before they were allowed to know that the
treaty had been signed. From the time they
first heard of it they were every day expecting
to be set at liberty, and naturally grew very
impatient over the delay. On the 4th of April
they demanded bread instead of hard biscuit,
which they refused to eat. On the evening of
the 6th they showed great unwillingness to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
obey the order to retire to their quarters, and
some of them not only refused to do that,
but went beyond their prescribed limits.
Then Captain Shortland, who had charge of
the military guard, ordered them to fire on the
Americans, which they did. The soldiers, I
believe, fired a second time. Five prisoners
were killed and thirty-three wounded."</p>

<p>"Why, that was just murder, wasn't it,
grandma?" asked Ned. "And didn't they
hang those soldiers for doing it?"</p>

<p>"No; the British authorities called it 'justifiable
homicide,' which meant it was all right
enough."</p>

<p>"In which decision I, for one, am far from
agreeing," remarked Mr. Lilburn emphatically.</p>

<p>"It created intense indignation in this country
at the time," said the captain; "but is now
seldom remembered, and the two nations are,
and I hope always will be, good friends."</p>

<p>The <i>Dolphin</i> ascended the river only as far
as Bangor, and returned by moonlight to Castine,
where they anchored for some hours; then
at an early hour in the morning they steamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
out into the ocean again, and pursued a westward
course until they reached Portland.
There they landed and paid a visit to the
cemetery where lay the remains of the brave
captains of the <i>Enterprise</i> and the <i>Boxer</i>; also
those of Midshipman Kervin Waters.</p>

<p>"They are buried side by side, as if they
were brothers, instead of enemies who were
killed fighting each other," said little Elsie
softly. "But perhaps they were good Christian
men, each fighting for what he thought
was the right of his own country. Papa, can
you tell us about the funeral? I suppose they
had one?"</p>

<p>"Yes, daughter, a solemn and imposing one.
The two battered vessels were lying at the end
of Union Wharf. A civil and military procession
had been formed at the court-house at
nine in the morning of the 9th of September.
The coffins were brought from the vessels in
barges of ten oars each, rowed by minute
strokes of ship-masters and mates, most of the
barges and boats in the harbor accompanying
them. When the barges began to move, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
while the procession was passing through the
streets to the church, minute guns were fired
by artillery companies. Also while the procession
marched from the church to the cemetery
here, which is about a mile distant from the
church.</p>

<p>"The chief mourners who followed the
corpse of Captain Burrows were Dr. Washington,
Captain Hull, and officers of the <i>Enterprise</i>.
Those who followed Captain Blyth's
were the officers of the <i>Boxer</i>, on parole. Both
were followed by naval and military officers in
the United States service, the crews of the two
vessels, civil officers of the State and city, military
companies, and a large concourse of citizens.
Only a few weeks before Captain Blyth
was one of the pall-bearers at the funeral of
our Lawrence, the gallant commander of the
<i>Chesapeake</i>, at Halifax."</p>

<p>"That dear brave man that said, 'Don't give
up the ship,' papa?" asked Elsie.</p>

<p>"Yes, daughter. Now let us read the inscription
on his tombstone: 'In memory of
Captain Samuel Blyth, late Commander of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Britannic Majesty's brig <i>Boxer</i>. He nobly fell
on the 5th day of September, 1813, in action
with the United States brig <i>Enterprise</i>. In
life honorable; in death glorious. His country
will long deplore one of her bravest sons,
his friends long lament one of the best of men.
Æ. 29. The surviving officers of his crew
offer this feeble tribute of admiration and respect.'"</p>

<p>"It sounds as though they had respected
and loved him," said the little girl. "That
next grave is where Burrows lies, isn't it,
papa? and won't you please read its inscription?"</p>

<p>They drew nearer and the captain read
aloud: "'Beneath this stone moulders the
body of William Burrows, late commander of
the United States brig <i>Enterprise</i>, who was
mortally wounded on the 5th of September,
1813, in an action which contributed to increase
the fame of American valor, by capturing
his Britannic Majesty's brig <i>Boxer</i>, after a
severe contest of forty-five minutes. Æ. 28.
A passing stranger has erected this memento<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of respect to the manes of a patriot, who, in
the hour of peril, obeyed the loud summons of
an injured country, and who gallantly met,
fought, and conquered the foeman.'"</p>

<p>"And that one on the pillars, papa&mdash;whose
is it?" Elsie asked, as her father paused with
a slight sigh.</p>

<p>"That is the tomb of Midshipman Waters,"
he said. "We will go nearer and read its inscription:
'Beneath this marble, by the side of
his gallant commander, rest the remains of
Lieutenant Kervin Waters, a native of Georgetown,
District of Columbia, who received a
mortal wound, September 5, 1813, while a
midshipman on board the United States brig
<i>Enterprise</i>, in an action with his Britannic
Majesty's brig <i>Boxer</i>, which terminated in the
capture of the latter. He languished in
severe pain, which he endured with fortitude,
until September 25, 1813, when he died with
Christian calmness and resignation, aged
eighteen. The young men of Portland erect
this stone as a testimony of their respect for
his valor and virtues.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Twenty days to suffer so," sighed Elsie.
"Oh, it was dreadful!"</p>

<p>Max and Evelyn stood near, side by side.</p>

<p>"Dreadful indeed!" Evelyn sighed, in low
quivering tones as they turned away. "Oh,
Max! I wish you did not belong to the
navy!"</p>

<p>"Why, dearest?" he asked in tender tones.
"It is not only in the navy that men die suddenly
and of injuries; and many a naval officer
has lived to old age and died at home in his
bed. And we are under the same Protecting
Care on the sea as on the land."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is a cheering thought," she said,
"and since you love the sea, it is wrong and
selfish in me to regret your choice of a profession.
And I could not be induced to resign
my sailor lover for any landsman," she added,
with a charming blush and smile.</p>

<p>That evening, joining her father, as she so
often did, in his quiet promenade of the deck
before retiring for the night, Lucilla spoke of
their visit to the cemetery, and said, "I have
always been so glad that you left the navy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
papa, so that we could have you always at
home with us, and I am gladder still when I
think that if we should have another war you
will not be in danger of such a fate as that
which befell Burrows and Blyth."</p>

<p>"Unless I am needed, volunteer my services,
and am accepted," he returned, in a slightly
playful tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, don't, please don't!" she exclaimed,
clinging more closely to him. "It
will be dreadful enough to have Max in such
danger, but to have you, too, in it would be
heart-breaking."</p>

<p>"Well, dear child, we won't be so foolish as
to trouble ourselves about what may never
happen. And if it ever should happen, we
must just put our trust in the Lord, believing
that he doeth all things well, and trusting
his promise, 'As thy days, so shall thy strength
be.' And you can rejoice in the fact that
Chester is neither sailor nor soldier," he
added, with a smile, and softly patting the
hand resting upon his arm.</p>

<p>"Yes, father dear, that is no small comfort,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
she said; "especially as I know he is patriotic
enough to do all in his power for his country."</p>

<p>"Ah, no doubt of that! I think Chester
would be as ready as any one else to take up
arms in her defence if he saw that his services
were needed. And I don't believe this daughter
of mine would say a word to prevent him."</p>

<p>"I think not, papa; but I hope I may never
be tried in that way."</p>

<p>"A hope in which I heartily join you, daughter.
I should be glad indeed to know that we
were done with wars. But that is so uncertain
that we, as a nation, must be ever prepared
to repel attack&mdash;on land or sea. 'Eternal
vigilance is the price of liberty.'"</p>

<p>"And liberty is worth that price, isn't it,
father?" she said, with a bright smile up into
his face.</p>

<p>"Yes; so we think; we could never be content
without it."</p>

<p>They paced silently back and forth for a
few moments, then Lucilla asked, "How long
are we going to lie quietly here in Portland
harbor, papa?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"That will depend upon the wishes of the
majority of our company," he answered;
"which I think we will learn at the breakfast
table to-morrow morning."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a bright and cheerful party that
gathered about the <i>Dolphin's</i> breakfast table
the next morning. Greetings were exchanged,
a blessing asked upon the food, and Captain
Raymond began helping his guests.</p>

<p>"I notice we are still lying quietly in Portland
harbor," remarked Dr. Percival. "Do
we remain here another day, captain?"</p>

<p>"That must be as the majority decide,"
was the pleasant-toned rejoinder. "Please,
friends, express your wishes freely."</p>

<p>No one spoke for a moment&mdash;each waiting
for the others. Then Violet said, in her lively
pleasant way, "Cousin Ronald, you are the
eldest, and should feel entitled to speak first."</p>

<p>"Thanks, cousin," he returned, "but I
really have no choice; am perfectly willing to
go or stay, as may best please the majority of
my friends here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you think of returning directly to Bar
Harbor, captain?" asked Mrs. Travilla.</p>

<p>"If that is what you would all prefer,
mother. But how would you all like to take
a short sea voyage&mdash;sailing eastwardly from
here, at some distance from the coast, and
perhaps going on up the coast of New Brunswick?"</p>

<p>Every one, from Mr. Lilburn down to little
Ned, seemed charmed with the idea, and as
the weather was all that could be desired, it
was decided that they would start as soon as
the anchor could be lifted and sufficient steam
gotten up. They carried out their plan, and
had a delightful voyage lasting several
days.</p>

<p>It was on Saturday that they left Portland;
the Sabbath found them far from land, and, as
at former times, services were conducted on
board the yacht with the singing of hymns, the
offering up of prayers, the reading of the
Scriptures, and of a sermon by Captain Raymond.</p>

<p>After that they formed themselves into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Bible class, and Mr. Lilburn was persuaded to
take the lead, choosing the subject while the
others sat about him, Bibles in hand. Opening
his, the dear old gentleman began:</p>

<p>"Let us take for our theme Jesus Christ
our Lord, and what it is so to know him that
we shall have eternal life. Here in the seventeenth
chapter of John's gospel in his&mdash;the
Master's&mdash;wonderful prayer we read, 'And this
is life eternal, that they might know thee the
only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou
hast sent.' Paul tells us in his letter to the
Philippians, 'I count all things but loss for
the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus
my Lord.' His acquaintance was not with the
Christ of Galilee, whom he had not known,
but with the ascended Christ; he who said to
the Apostle John on Patmos, 'I am he that
liveth and was dead, and behold I am alive
again forever more.' In the tenth verse of
the first chapter of his gospel John tells us,
'He was in the world and the world was made
by him and the world knew him not.' In first
John third chapter and last clause of the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
verse, 'Therefore the world knoweth us not,
because it knew him not.' A self-seeking,
worldly-minded man does not know Christ, and
cannot understand him who is aiming day by
day to live above the world and get the Christ
view of life. Captain, can you tell us why it
is that the worldly-minded do not know
Jesus?"</p>

<p>"Because," replied the captain, "the cares
and pleasures of this world are crowding Him
out of their hearts, as he himself tells us in the
parable of the sower. But some of those who
loved him failed for a time to recognize him
when he was close to them. In the last chapter
of his gospel John tells us, 'But when the
morning was now come, Jesus stood on the
shore; but the disciples knew not that it was
Jesus.' Mary also had failed at first to recognize
him when he spoke to her as she stood
weeping beside his sepulchre. And how long
he talked with those two on the way to Emmaus,
and they did not recognize him until he
sat down to eat with them, took bread, and
blessed and brake it, and then vanished out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
their sight! Ah, Jesus is often near us and we
know him not."</p>

<p>"And he is our Master," said Mrs. Travilla,
in her low, sweet tones. "In John thirteen,
thirteenth, talking with his disciples Jesus
says, 'Ye call me Master and Lord; and ye say
well, for so I am.' And Paul tells the Ephesians
that their Master is in heaven. 'And
ye masters do the same things unto them, forbearing,
threatening, knowing that your Master
also is in heaven.'"</p>

<p>"There are five Greek words translated Master,"
continued the captain; "one meaning
overseer, another teacher, still another signifying
absolute ownership; another, leader&mdash;one
who goes before us; still another, one exercising
supreme authority or power. Oh, that
to-day each one of us may know Christ as our
supreme Lord and Master who alone has absolute
ownership of our lives and all our powers."</p>

<p>"Let us look for other texts bearing upon
this subject," said Mr. Lilburn. "Have not
you one for us, Harold?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Harold, "here in first John,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
second chapter, is given a test of our knowledge
of Christ. 'Hereby do we know that we
know him if we keep his commandments. He
that saith I know him and keepeth not his
commandments is a liar and the truth is not in
him.'"</p>

<p>"And here in John's gospel," said Mrs. Lilburn,
"where Jesus is talking with his disciples,
that same night in which he was betrayed,
he says: 'A new commandment I give
unto you, That ye love one another; as I have
loved you, that ye also love one another. By
this shall all men know that ye are my disciples,
if ye have love one to another.'"</p>

<p>"And again," said Evelyn, "in the fifteenth
chapter and twelfth verse, 'This is my commandment,
That ye love one another, as I
have loved you. Greater love hath no man
than this, that a man lay down his life for his
friends.'"</p>

<p>"What wonderful love&mdash;oh, what wonderful
love was His!" exclaimed Mrs. Travilla, in low
moved tones. "And how sweet are those
words: 'I have loved thee with an everlasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
love.' 'For a small moment have I forsaken
thee; but with great mercies will I gather
thee.'"</p>

<p>"Let us sing to His praise," suggested Mr.
Lilburn, and Violet, seating herself at the
instrument, struck a few chords, then started
the hymn:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;My dear Redeemer's praise,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the others joining in with a will&mdash;evidently
singing with spirit and understanding, for the
sweet words were familiar to all.</p>

<p>The short service over, they scattered in
groups here and there, chatting quietly with
each other.</p>

<p>For a few moments Mrs. Travilla and her
cousin and old-time intimate friend, Annis&mdash;now
Mrs. Lilburn&mdash;were together a little apart
from the others, talking low and confidentially.
They talked of the past, the present, and the
future, as regarded life in both this world and
the next.</p>

<p>"How sweet is that Bible lesson which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
have just had," said Annis, at length. "How
I love those words of Jesus&mdash;'Ye call me Master
and Lord; and ye say well; for so I am.'"</p>

<p>"Yes," returned Elsie; "they are very dear
to me. Oh, how sweet to know that he is ever
with us&mdash;always close at hand, full of love, infinite
in power and willingness to bless; to help
in every trouble, to give 'the oil of joy for
mourning and the garment of praise for the
spirit of heaviness.' Oh, how true are the
words: 'The joy of the Lord is your strength.'
If we only have that we can bear all troubles
and trials. It makes one happy in the present,
and takes away all dread of the future; so
sweet and sustaining is it to know that He who
has all power in heaven and on earth is your
friend, loving you with an everlasting, infinite
love; caring for you at all times and in all
places."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Annis softly. "'Sing, O
daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and
rejoice with all thy heart, O daughter of Jerusalem'
... 'The Lord thy God in the midst
of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he
will joy over thee with singing.' Are they not
sweet words, Elsie?"</p>

<p>"Indeed they are! These others too&mdash;'God
commendeth his love toward us, in that while
we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.'"</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence; then Annis
said, "You seem to me a very happy Christian,
Elsie. Is it not because the joy of the
Lord is indeed your strength?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Annis, who could be otherwise than
happy in the consciousness of that love; and in
the thought of how soon one will be with the
Master, and like Him; and with all the dear
ones gone before, never, never to be separated
from them again?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear cousin, and how blest are we in
the knowledge that our dear ones gone before
were His, and are with Him now, and will be
ready to greet us with great joy when we too
shall reach that blessed shore."</p>

<p>"'The joy of the Lord is your strength,'"
again quoted Mrs. Travilla, in her low, sweet
tones. "Don't you think, Annis, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Covenanters and Puritans,&mdash;good, devoted
Christians as most of them were,&mdash;in opposing
the lightness, worldly-mindedness, and frivolity
of their foes, went too far to the other extreme,
leaving out from their teachings the joy of
the Lord? Do you not remember that the
Jews were told by Nehemiah, Ezra, and the
others, 'This day is holy unto the Lord your
God; mourn not nor weep. Go your way, eat
the fat and drink the sweet; and send portions
unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for
this day is holy unto our Lord; neither be ye
sorry; for the joy of the Lord is your strength.
So the Levites stilled all the people, saying,
Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither
be ye grieved. And all the people went their
way, to eat, and to drink, and to send portions,
and to make great mirth, because they had
understood the words that were declared unto
them.'"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Annis, "it seems to be human
nature to go to extremes, and I think much
harm is often done in that way. For instance,
the Covenanters and Puritans of old times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
were so disgusted with the errors and selfish
indulgences of the Papists&mdash;their turning the
Sabbath into a holiday, which might rightly
be spent in merrymaking and sport&mdash;that they
themselves robbed it of all enjoyment, and
made it a dull, gloomy time to their young
people, with little or no hint in it of the
strengthening joy of the Lord."</p>

<p>"I think you are right," returned Mrs. Travilla,
in a musing tone. "The Sabbath is not
a day for frivolity, but it is one for joy and
gladness&mdash;the joy of the Lord strengthening
us for duty, trial, and temptation. What but
that sustained the martyrs when called upon to
lay down their lives for the sake of Him who
died to redeem them? And oh, how that gracious,
precious promise, 'As thy days, so shall
thy strength be,' relieves one of the dread of
what the future may have in store for us; what
bereavements, losses, sufferings, mental or
physical! How often and sweetly He bids us
fear not. 'O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed
thee, I have called thee by thy name;
thou art mine. When thou passest through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the waters, I will be with thee; and through the
rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou
walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be
burned; neither shall the flames kindle upon
thee. For I am the Lord, thy God, the Holy
One of Israel, thy Saviour.'"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Annis, "oh, how often, how
tenderly he bids us fear not. It is like a
mother hushing her frightened child. 'Say
to them that are of a fearful heart, fear not....
Fear thou not, for I am with thee....
For I the Lord thy God will hold thy right
hand, saying to thee, fear not, I will help
thee. Fear not, I have redeemed thee, thou
art mine.... Fear not, O Jacob my servant,
and Jeshurun whom I have chosen.'"</p>

<p>"'Whom I have chosen,'" repeated Elsie.
"How those words bring to mind what Jesus our
dear Master said to his disciples in that last
talk with them in the room where they had
eaten the passover&mdash;'Ye have not chosen me,
but I have chosen you.' Oh, what love and
condescension to choose us sinful creatures for
his own!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"'And ordained you that ye should go and
bring forth fruit,'" said Annis, going on with
the quotation, "'and that your fruit should
remain; that whatsoever ye shall ask the
Father in my name, he will give it you.' I
remember," she went on musingly, "that when
I was a little girl I used to think I should like
to be a Christian, and would be if only I knew
how. The way seems very easy now&mdash;just to
listen to the dear Saviour's gracious invitation,
'Come unto me all ye that labor and are
heavy laden, and I will give you rest,' accept
it, and give myself to him."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Elsie, "his promise joined to
that&mdash;'and ye shall find rest unto your souls'&mdash;is
sure; it never fails."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> the next Sabbath our friends had
returned to Bar Harbor. For some weeks
longer they remained in that vicinity; then,
cooler weather making a more southerly climate
desirable, they sailed for home. Dr.
Percival was so far recovered that he felt in
haste to get back to Torriswood and at work
among his patients again. He and his Maude
paid a flying visit to old friends and relatives
at the Oaks and Ion, then hastened to
Louisiana by rail.</p>

<p>Max Raymond, to the great satisfaction of
himself, his <i>fiancée</i>, and his friends, was favored
with a lengthening of his furlough, which
enabled him to spend some weeks at home in
his father's house. Lucilla persuaded Evelyn
to be her guest at the same time, Chester was
there every evening, and so the courting went
merrily on. There was much talk about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
new house the captain proposed building,
much discussion of the question whether the
one building should be made suitable and sufficiently
large for two families,&mdash;half of it for
Max and Eva,&mdash;or whether a separate house
should be put up for them in another part of
the grounds. The decision was finally left to
the brides-elect, and as they were very strongly
attached, and Max was likely to be often away
on the sea for months and years together, they
thought it best the two dwellings should be
under the same roof, and their decision was
highly approved by the captain and all their
relatives and friends.</p>

<p>Then followed consultations in regard to
the exact spot upon which it should stand, and
the studying and comparing of plans to make
it as commodious, convenient, and beautiful
as possible. The captain was evidently ready
to go to any reasonable amount of expense in
order to give them an ideal home, his means
being ample and his love for his children very
great.</p>

<p>But all the time was not spent in that way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
for other relatives claimed a share in Max's
prized companionship; invitations were given
and visits paid to the Oaks, Ion, Fairview, the
Laurels, Roselands, Pinegrove, Ashlands, and
Riverside. Sometimes the invitation was for
dinner or tea, sometimes for the whole day&mdash;or
longer for the young folks, if not for the
older ones and the children. It was on the
last day of October they dined at Riverside,
nearly all the connection meeting them there,
and at Rosie's earnest solicitation Evelyn and
Lucilla, Max and Chester accepted an invitation
to stay until the next morning, Captain
Raymond giving a rather unwilling consent to
let Lucilla do so.</p>

<p>"It is Hallowe'en, you know, and I'm just
pining for a bit of fun," Rosie said privately
to the girls, after seeing the older guests depart.
"You two are engaged, to be sure, but
'there's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the
lip,'" she added, with a laugh and a twinkle of
fun in her eye.</p>

<p>"But we are not wanting slips," laughed
Lucilla.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nor much afraid we will get them," added
Evelyn merrily. "Still we might have a little
fun."</p>

<p>"Provided we take it early enough to get to
bed in good season," added Lucilla, in a mirthful
tone. "My father, you know, is very particular
about that&mdash;so kindly anxious is he to
keep me in good health."</p>

<p>"Which is altogether right, wise, and kind,
I am sure," returned Rosie; "and I don't intend
to tempt you to go contrary to his wishes.
I'm obliged to him for granting my request for
permission to keep you here all night, and I
shall not urge you to stay up later than he
would allow you to if you were at home. If
we try some old-fashioned games we can suit
ourselves as to the hour for the experiments."</p>

<p>"Yes," laughed Evelyn, "I shall be quite as
sure of the fulfilment of the augury if we get
it some hours earlier than people of old times
used to look for it."</p>

<p>"Then we will just wait till our old folks get
to bed&mdash;which they always do in good season,"
said Rosie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your husband approves, I suppose?" remarked
Lucilla inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" laughed Rosie; "he sees no harm
in it, and approves of his wife having all the
pleasure she can. I wish we could have had
Grace stay and share the fun, but her father
vetoed that almost before I had fairly given
the invitation."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lucilla, "poor Gracie is so
feeble that father has to be very careful of
her."</p>

<p>"Yes; I know," said Rosie, "but I thought
he might have left her for once, considering
that my two doctor brothers are here for the
night&mdash;unless called out by some inconveniently
sick person."</p>

<p>"Which we will hope they won't be, for even
doctors should have a little amusement once
in a while," said Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rosie, "and they enjoyed the
golf this afternoon, and appear to be having a
pleasant time with Max, Chester, and the
others out on the river bank there now."</p>

<p>The girls were on the veranda overlooking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the river, and just at that moment were joined
by Rosie's mother-in-law, the older Mrs. Croly.
She sat down and chatted with them for a few
moments, then bade them good-night, and
went to her own apartments. It was growing
dusk then, the young men came in, and presently
they all repaired to the drawing-room,
where for the next hour or two they entertained
each other with music and conversation.
Max had some interesting adventures to narrate,
to which both young men and maidens
were eager listeners.</p>

<p>In the pause that followed the conclusion of
the second tale the clock in the hall was heard
to strike.</p>

<p>"Eleven!" exclaimed Lucilla, in a tone of
surprise and dismay. "Father would say I
ought to have gone to my room and my bed
more than an hour ago."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! not on Hallowe'en," laughed Rosie;
and just then a servant brought in a basket
filled with ears of corn, and set it down in their
midst.</p>

<p>"What's that for, Rosie?" asked Harold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
"You can hardly ask your guests to eat raw
corn, especially at this late hour? As a physician
I must most emphatically enter my protest."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Rosie is benevolently trying to
bring practice into her brothers' hands," remarked
Herbert facetiously. "But we are
not looking for that at present, but for fun&mdash;pure
fun, that will bring damage to nobody."</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear brothers, that's what I am
endeavoring to do," she returned in sprightly
tones. "Perhaps you have not heard of the
new game with ears of corn? You folks are
all invited to be blindfolded, each in turn, and
in that condition to draw out an ear of corn by
which to foretell your future fate. A tasselled
ear will promise you great joy, a big, full one
good luck for a year. A short one will mean a
gift is coming, a red or yellow one no luck at
all."</p>

<p>"Quite a new idea," said Herbert, "and as
there is nothing said about love or marriage, I
suppose even engaged folks may try it; married
ones also."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" replied Rosie, producing a dainty
lace-trimmed handkerchief. "Eva, will you
kindly consent to take the first turn?"</p>

<p>"If you wish it," returned Evelyn, and the
handkerchief was bound about her head and
she was led to the basket.</p>

<p>"I suppose I am not to choose by feeling,
either, but just to take the first one I happen
to touch?" she said inquiringly.</p>

<p>The others assented, and she drew out an
ear.</p>

<p>"Oh, good luck for you!" exclaimed Rosie.
"It is as big and full a one as the basket
holds."</p>

<p>Lucilla was told it was her turn, the handkerchief
was bound about her eyes, and she
stooped over the basket and drew out quite a
short ear.</p>

<p>"Ah, you see I am not so lucky as you were,
Eva," she exclaimed, passing her fingers from
end to end.</p>

<p>"But it isn't bad," said Rosie. "That
means a gift is coming to you soon."</p>

<p>"A good or a bad one?" laughed Lucilla.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
"Perhaps papa would say I deserved a bad
one for staying up so late."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I think he expected something of
the kind&mdash;he declined to let Grace stay, you
know," said Rosie, "and I did want her badly.
Well, gentlemen, which of you will take his
turn now?"</p>

<p>At that they all insisted that she should take
hers first, which she did, bringing out a tasselled
ear.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am fortunate!" she cried, with a
merry peal of laughter, "for a tasselled ear is
said to mean great joy."</p>

<p>After that the young men took their turns.
Chester got a big, full ear, Max a short one,
Herbert a tasselled one, Harold a yellow one,
which Rosie told him with sighs and groans
meant no luck at all.</p>

<p>"But don't be discouraged, brother dear,"
she said, patting him affectionately on the
shoulder, "though older than myself, you are
young enough to have lots of good luck after
this year is out."</p>

<p>"Many thanks for the assurance, sister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
mine," he laughed, "and though older than
yourself, I believe I am young enough to wait
a year for any special good luck."</p>

<p>"And I hope you will have enough afterward
to reward you for the patient waiting,
Uncle Harold," said Lucilla.</p>

<p>"If he gets all he deserves it will be a great
deal," added Evelyn.</p>

<p>"You are good, kind comforters&mdash;both;
accept my warmest thanks," laughed Harold.</p>

<p>There was a little more lively chat, then
the young girls said good-night and went to
their rooms&mdash;two on the second floor with a
communicating door between. Rosie accompanied
them, leaving her husband to attend
to the gentlemen guests.</p>

<p>"See here, girls," she said, pointing to a
basket of rosy-cheeked apples on a stand;
"these were put here to induce you to try another
Hallowe'en experiment. If you want to
see what your future husbands will look like,
eat one of these standing before the mirror,
brushing your hair all the time, and now and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
then&mdash;when you can get up courage enough&mdash;look
over your left shoulder."</p>

<p>"Oh, that won't require any courage,
Rosie," laughed Evelyn. "I am not in the
least afraid of Max&mdash;brave officer though
he is."</p>

<p>"And I stand in quite as little fear of Chester,"
said Lucilla. "So that really it seems
that your good apples will be almost thrown
away."</p>

<p>"Ah, you two forget the 'many a slip 'twixt
the cup and the lip,'" laughed Rosie. "And
it cannot possibly do your lovers any harm, or
alienate their affections from you."</p>

<p>"No, we are not at all afraid of that," said
Lucilla, "and as your apples look very tempting,
I believe I shall run the risk of eating one
presently. I suppose I must first don a dressing
gown and take down my hair."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rosie; "you are to stand before
the mirror brushing it diligently while eating
the apple. And you will try it too, won't you,
Eva?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes," returned Evelyn, "just for fun;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and if anybody but Max comes to me I shall be
sure it is not a truthful augury."</p>

<p>"Max is a fine fellow and has always been
one of my favorites," said Rosie, "but there
are others in the world that might do just as
well, in case you and Max should have a falling
out. Or you may live long enough to marry
several times."</p>

<p>Evelyn laughed at that, saying she was
quite sure once would be enough for her.</p>

<p>"I know you girls did not come prepared
to stay all night," said Rosie, "so I have laid
out a night-dress and dressing-gown for each
of you. Get into them, and you will look nice
and pretty enough for an interview with your
future husbands."</p>

<p>They thanked her, and, examining the garments
which she took from a wardrobe in Eva's
room, pronounced them really pretty enough
to wear to the breakfast table.</p>

<p>They made haste with their toilets, and in a
few minutes each was standing before a mirror,
eating an apple and brushing out her hair.
Then Rosie left them with a promise to be back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
again before very long to learn of their success.
She artfully left ajar both doors leading into
the hall. They opened noiselessly, and presently
each had admitted a young man, who,
wearing slippers, moved with noiseless tread,
and as the girls looked over their left shoulders
Eva caught sight of Harold standing a few
feet in her rear, gazing steadily at her, a kindly
smile upon his features; while at the same moment
Lucilla perceived Herbert at a similar
distance from her, gazing intently and admiringly
upon her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Herbert," she laughed, "this
cannot be a true sign, for I know well enough
that neither of us has any loverlike feeling
toward the other."</p>

<p>Almost before she finished her sentence
he had vanished, and she heard Evelyn saying
in mirthful tones, "Ah, Uncle Harold, this is
the no luck at all&mdash;prophesied by that yellow
ear of corn; for, as you know, I am already
pledged to another."</p>

<p>At that Harold sighed deeply and withdrew.</p>

<p>But scarcely had he and his brother disappeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
when Max silently took his place, Chester
at the same time coming up behind Lucilla
so that she saw him in the mirror, to which she
had again turned, brush in hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, is it you, Chester? You are the right
man in the right place," she laughed.</p>

<p>"I hope so, darling," he returned. "What
lovely hair!" passing his hand caressingly
over it; "so long and thick too. I never before
saw it to such advantage."</p>

<p>Max was standing silently behind Evelyn,
and just at that moment she caught sight of
him in the glass. She turned quickly, and
he caught her in his arms, giving her a rapturous
kiss.</p>

<p>"Don't be disappointed that I am your
future mate," he said.</p>

<p>"Certainly not, since you were already my
own free choice," she returned, looking up
into his face with one of her sweetest smiles.
Just then Lucilla's voice was heard coming
from the next room, "Is that you, Max?" and
in a moment the four were together, gayly
laughing and chatting, both young men insisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
that that style of wearing the hair&mdash;streaming
over the shoulders&mdash;was extremely
becoming. Then Rosie and her Will joined
them for a moment, after which they all bade
good-night, and the girls were left alone to
seek repose.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> young people had a merry time over
their breakfast the next morning, rehearsing
all they had gone through in their celebration
of Hallowe'en, each one seeming to have enjoyed
his or her part in it. They lingered over
the meal, but soon after leaving the table scattered
to their homes, excepting Eva, who returned
to Woodburn with Max and Lucilla.</p>

<p>On arriving there Lucilla hastened to the
library, where she found her father examining
some business letters.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, papa!" she said. "Here
is your amanuensis, and haven't you something
for her to do?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, looking up at her with a
smile, as she stood close at his side, "and the
first thing is to give her father a kiss; that is,
if she will not find it a disagreeable task."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Anything else than that, father dear," she
returned, bending down to give and receive a
caress. "And won't you let me help, as usual,
with your correspondence?"</p>

<p>"I shall be very glad to do so," he returned,
rising to take the cover from her typewriter,
and put the paper in place. Then she seated
herself and he began dictating. When they
had finished, "Did you miss me last night and
this morning, father?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I did indeed," he said; "but that is something
I will have to get used to, when Chester
takes you from me."</p>

<p>He ended with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, don't sigh so over it!" she exclaimed.
"You know it isn't as if I had to
go away to a distance from you. I shall be
close at hand, and you can call me to your side
whenever you will."</p>

<p>"Which will be pretty often, I think," he
said, with a smile, drawing her closer to him,
and caressing her hair and cheek with his hand.
"Had you a pleasant time last evening? And
did you go to bed in season, as your father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
would have seen that you did had you been at
home?"</p>

<p>"No, I did not get to bed early, papa," she
replied. "I thought you would excuse me for
staying up, for once, to try my fortune. For
you see, we all wanted to know who were to be
our future life partners, Rosie telling us that
there was 'many a slip 'twixt the cup and the
lip,' so that our engagements didn't make us
safe."</p>

<p>She concluded with a light laugh and
look that seemed to say she felt no
fear that he would be seriously displeased
with her.</p>

<p>"You stayed up to try your fortune, did
you?" he returned, with a look of amusement.
"Why, my child, I thought you considered
it already made."</p>

<p>"So I do, papa, and last night's experience
only confirmed my belief."</p>

<p>Then she went on to tell him the whole
story, he seeming to enjoy the tale as she told
it.</p>

<p>"You are not vexed with me, papa, for staying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
up so late, just for once?" she asked, when
her tale was told.</p>

<p>"No," he replied, "though I should be far
from willing to have you make a practice of it.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Early to bed and early to rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the old saying is, and I want you to be all
three."</p>

<p>"As you are, father; and I am the first, at
all events," she returned, with a happy little
laugh. "You have never had to pay a big
doctor's bill for me."</p>

<p>"No; but to escape that is the least of my
reasons for wanting to keep you healthy."</p>

<p>Just then Max came in with Eva, bringing
a book on architecture.</p>

<p>"Here are some plans for houses, father,"
he said, laying the book open before the captain.
"Please look at this, and tell me what
you think of it, as in some respects it is what
would suit us. You too, Lu. Eva and I like
the most of it very much."</p>

<p>The captain and Lucilla examined it with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
interest, and were as well pleased as were Max
and Evelyn. It was a matter in which they
and Chester also were deeply interested, and
they were taking time and trouble to make sure
of having their future home all that could be
desired. It was not to be built in haste.
They had agreed to take plenty of time and
thought in regard to all the interior arrangements,
making everything as convenient as
possible, as well as to the exterior, which they
were resolved should be such as to cause the
building to be recognized as an ornament to
its neighborhood.</p>

<p>Chester was the one most anxious to get the
house built and to secure his bride; the other
three seemed well content to defer their marriage
until the captain should give full and
hearty consent.</p>

<p>The exact spot on which the building should
stand had been selected, and the plans for it
almost matured, when there came an order for
Max to join a naval vessel about to sail for a
distant foreign port.</p>

<p>There was a tender and sorrowful leave-taking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and Max was absent from the home
circle for many months.</p>

<p>For a time those left behind seemed to have
lost much of their interest in the building of
the new home. Then came the fall rains, after
that the winter storms, and it was decided that
the actual work should not be begun until
spring. Then Grace had a serious illness,
which kept her in bed for several weeks, and
she had hardly recovered when the little ones
at Fairview were taken down with measles.
They all passed through that trouble safely,
but the weather had now grown warm enough
to make a more northern climate desirable,
and they&mdash;the whole Fairview family, accompanied
by their grandma and the Raymonds&mdash;went
aboard the captain's yacht and sailed up
the coast and the Hudson River to Evelyn's
pretty home, Crag Cottage.</p>

<p>That became their headquarters for the summer,
though occasional short trips were taken
to one or another of the points of interest in
New York and the adjoining States. They all
enjoyed themselves, though Chester and Max<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
were missed&mdash;especially by Lucilla and Evelyn.
Chester, however, joined the party late in the
season, and was with them on the journey
home.</p>

<p>Soon after their return, work was begun
upon the proposed site of the new double dwelling,
the cellars were dug, and the foundation
was laid. But the work proceeded slowly.
Max was not likely to be at home again soon,
and it was well to take time to have everything
done in the best possible manner.</p>

<p>Evelyn and Lucilla had fully decided upon
a double wedding, which of course could not
take place until Max obtained a furlough, and
came home for a visit of some weeks or
months. Chester felt the delay hard upon
him, but had to content himself with being
allowed to spend all his spare time with his
betrothed.</p>

<p>Fall and winter passed quietly. There were
the usual holiday festivities and exchange of
gifts, then quiet home duties and pleasures
filled up the days, and the weeks glided swiftly
by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>One morning in February the captain, looking
over his daily paper, uttered an exclamation
of mingled regret and indignation.</p>

<p>"What is it, my dear?" asked Violet.
"Something that troubles you, I perceive."</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied; "here is a piece of very
bad news. The <i>Maine</i>, one of our favorite
battleships, lying at anchor in Havana harbor,
has been suddenly destroyed by a terrible explosion&mdash;wrecked
and sent to the bottom with
266 American seamen; only the captain and a
few of his officers who were on shore escaping
the awful fate of the others."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is dreadful, dreadful!" cried Violet.
"But how did it happen? What was the
cause?"</p>

<p>"That has yet to be discovered, my dear,"
replied Captain Raymond; "but I have little
doubt that it was the work of some enemy
among the Spaniards. They have been angry
at the presence of the vessel in their harbor&mdash;their
newspapers calling it a taunt and a banter,
for they know our people sympathize with
the Cubans. Somebody has done this evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
deed; it remains to be discovered who it
was."</p>

<p>"This is Sigsbee's despatch to the government,"
he added, and read aloud:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<i>Maine</i> blown up in Havana Harbor at nine-forty to-night.
Many wounded and doubtless more killed or
drowned. Wounded and others on board Spanish
man-of-war and Ward Line steamers. Send light-house
tenders from Key West for crew and the few pieces
of equipment above water. None has clothing other
than that upon him. Public opinion should be suspended
until further report. All officers believed to be
saved. Jenkins and Merritt not yet accounted for.
Many Spanish officers, including representatives of
General Blanco, now with me to express sympathy."</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">"<span class="smcap">Sigsbee.</span>"
</p></blockquote>

<p>It was directly after breakfast and the
family were all present. Lucilla and Grace
seemed much excited, and little Ned asked
anxiously if "Brother Max" was on that ship.</p>

<p>"No, my son," replied his father; "I am
very glad to know certainly that he was not.
Have you forgotten that he is with Commodore
Dewey on the coast of China?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, papa! I forgot where Havana was.
I remember now that it is not in China, but
in Cuba."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, that is a dreadful piece of news,
papa!" said Lucilla, in tones of excitement.
"Won't it be likely to bring on a war with
Spain&mdash;especially as we have been feeling so
sorry for the poor Cubans whom she has been
abusing so terribly?"</p>

<p>"I am really afraid it can hardly fail to
cause war," replied the captain. "But that
will depend very much upon the result of the
investigation which will no doubt be made by
our government."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope we won't have war!" cried
Grace, shuddering at the thought.</p>

<p>"War is a very dreadful thing," sighed her
father, "but sometimes the right thing on one
side&mdash;that of those who undertake it for the
downtrodden and oppressed."</p>

<p>"But we are not such folks, are we, papa?"
asked Ned.</p>

<p>"No, son; but the poor Cubans are, and the
question is whether we should not undertake
to win their freedom for them."</p>

<p>"By fighting the Spaniards who abuse them
so, papa?" asked little Elsie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What have they been doing to them,
papa?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"Oppressing, robbing, murdering them,
burning down their houses, forcing them into
the cities and towns and leaving them to
starve to death there."</p>

<p>"Why, papa, how dreadful! I should think
our folks ought to go and fight for them. I
wish I was big enough to help."</p>

<p>"My dear little son, I am glad you are not,"
said his mother, drawing him to her side and
giving him a fond caress.</p>

<p>"Why, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Because you might be badly hurt or even
killed, and that would break your mother's
heart."</p>

<p>"Then, mamma, I'm glad I don't have to
go, for I wouldn't like to hurt you so," said the
little fellow, stroking and patting his mother's
cheek, and gazing fondly into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope it won't come to war for us!"
exclaimed Grace; "though I should like to
have the poor Cubans helped. Just think how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
dreadful, if Max should be engaged in a naval
battle."</p>

<p>"Well, my child, we won't borrow trouble
about that," said her father soothingly.</p>

<p>"And I hope there is not much danger, as he
is away off in the China seas," said Lucilla, trying
to cheer Grace, though she herself had
little idea that he would escape taking part if
there should be war.</p>

<p>"In case of war, that will hardly excuse him
from doing his duty," said their father; "nor
would our dear brave boy wish to be excused.
But we will all pray that he may be spared injury,
if such be the Lord's will."</p>

<p>"Indeed we will, in that case, pour out constant
petitions for him&mdash;the dear fellow!"
said Violet, with emotion. "But, Levis, do
you think this will bring on war?"</p>

<p>"It looks very likely to me," replied her
husband, sadness perceptible in both his countenance
and tones. "And, really, I think it is
our duty to interfere for those poor, savagely
treated Cubans. I think it is high time that
this powerful people undertook their cause."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I suppose the Spaniards are already
angry with the Americans for sympathizing
with those poor, oppressed Cubans," said Lucilla.</p>

<p>"Yes," said her father, "and this awful
deed&mdash;the blowing up of our grand battleship
with its hundreds of sailors&mdash;is doubtless an
expression of their ill-will."</p>

<p>And that was not the thought of Captain
Raymond alone, but of many others as well.
The wrongs and sufferings of the Cubans had
so touched the hearts of thousands of the
Americans that they felt strongly impelled to
make some effort to help them to win their
freedom; and now this wanton destruction
of one of our favorite battleships&mdash;and,
what was far worse, the lives of nearly
three hundred innocent men&mdash;so increased
their anger and distrust that it could scarcely
be restrained. Through all the land of the
Americans there was a strong feeling of indignation
over the treachery and cruelty of
the blow that had destroyed that gallant ship
and sacrificed so many innocent lives; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
people were sternly quiet while the Court of
Inquiry was making its investigations. They
were ready to punish the doers of that dastardly
deed, but not without proof of their
guilt. For forty days they and their Congress
silently awaited the report of the board of
naval officers engaged in examining into the
evidences of the cause of the destruction of
the <i>Maine</i>. Their verdict came at length,
but in rather vague form&mdash;that, according to
the evidence obtainable, the vessel had been destroyed
by an explosion against her side from
without. So much was clearly proven, but
they did not say by whom the evil deed was
done. More than a week before that report
came in, both Congress and the people had
been greatly moved by the speech of Senator
Proctor, describing what he had witnessed in
Cuba, the scenes of starvation and horror;
men, women, and children robbed of their
homes, their cattle&mdash;all their earthly possessions&mdash;driven
into the towns and left to starve
to death in the streets.</p>

<p>The senator's speech made a great impression,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and there were others on the same subject
and in a like strain, delivered by members
of the commission sent to Cuba by the New
York <i>Journal</i>.</p>

<p>Some days later&mdash;on the 28th&mdash;came the report
of the Court of Inquiry into the <i>Maine</i>
catastrophe, and put an end to the patience of
Congress, which had long been ready to undertake
the cause of the oppressed and suffering
Cubans.</p>

<p>It was not until noon of the 11th of April
that the President's message reached Congress.
In that he turned over to it the whole policy of
the government toward Spain. Congress did
not make a formal declaration of war with
Spain until the 25th of April, but actual hostilities
began on the 19th. Indeed, four days
before the declaration of war the United
States navy began the blockade of Cuba, and
captured a vessel on the high seas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Max Raymond</span>, buried in thought, was pacing
the deck of the <i>Olympia</i>.</p>

<p>"Hello, Raymond, have you heard the
news?" asked a fellow officer, hurrying toward
him in evident excitement.</p>

<p>"No; what is it? News from home?" asked
Max, pausing in his walk with a look of eager
interest.</p>

<p>"Just that. The commodore has had a
warning to leave Hong-Kong. War has been
declared by our government, and Great Britain
has issued a proclamation of neutrality. The
official warning comes from the authorities
here."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Max, "I knew&mdash;we all
knew&mdash;that it would come soon. It is well
the commodore has had all our vessels put in
war paint, and every preparation made for
departure upon short notice."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; Commodore Dewey is a wise man and
officer. I'm glad he's at the head of affairs in
this fleet. It looks as if we would have some
fighting soon, Raymond."</p>

<p>"Yes, Dale, and it behooves us to be prepared
for wounds or death. We are about to
fight in a good cause, I think&mdash;for the freedom
of the poor, oppressed, downtrodden Cubans.
But where are we to go now, do you know?"</p>

<p>"Only that it must be out of this harbor
quite promptly. It can hardly be to travel
the seven thousand miles back to San Francisco."</p>

<p>They were not kept long in suspense. Presently,
anchors were taken up, and with bands
playing and flags flying the fleet of vessels
steamed out of the harbor, while the British
residents of the city crowded the quay and
shipping, cheering and saluting the Americans
as the warships passed. That first voyage
of the squadron was but a short one, a few
miles up the coast to Mirs Bay, a Chinese harbor,
where they anchored and awaited orders
from home, the <i>McCulloch</i> having been left behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
to bring them when they should arrive.
The next day she came, bringing this message,
dated Washington, April 24:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dewey</span>, Asiatic Squadron: War has commenced
between the United States and Spain. Proceed at once
to Philippine Islands. Commence operations at once,
particularly against the Spanish fleet. You must capture
the vessels or destroy. Use utmost endeavors."</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">"<span class="smcap">Long.</span>"<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This message was what Commodore Dewey
had been waiting for since his arrival at Hong-Kong
in January. He had formed his plans,
and was ready to carry them out without delay.
His captains were called to a short conference,
and about midnight the fleet sailed on its
errand of battle. They turned south toward
the Philippine Islands, 620 miles away. The
nearest United States port was San Francisco,
7000 miles distant. No neutral power would
permit him to take more than enough of coal
to carry his vessels home by the most direct
route, so that there was but one course open to
Dewey and his fleet&mdash;the capturing of a Spanish
harbor somewhere in Asiatic waters, which
he could make a naval base. One of Dewey's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
ships&mdash;the <i>Petrel</i>&mdash;was slow, and as the fleet
of vessels must keep together, that delayed
them. It was three days before they reached
the line of coast of the Island of Luzon. It
was reported that the enemy might be found in
Subig Bay, so that was carefully reconnoitred,
but the Spanish were not there; the fishermen
about the harbor said they had seen no Spanish
fleet, and though every nook and corner of
the bay was examined, not so much as a gunboat
could be found. So the American fleet
passed on to Manila, 30 miles away.</p>

<p>It seemed evident that the Spaniards had
chosen that station because there they would
have the aid of shore batteries. It is said that
their ships were comparatively antiquated, but
not so much so as to make their defeat at all
certain. Their guns were as good as those of
the American ships, and they had more of
them: to Dewey's six fighting ships Admiral
Montojo had ten, and two torpedo boats besides.
The Spaniards had no vessel to rank
with the <i>Olympia</i>, but the numbers of their
vessels, it might have been expected, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
probably, in skilled hands, have more than
made up for that. The Americans had the advantage
in batteries, but not overwhelmingly.
The <i>McCulloch</i> did not go into action at all,
and the Spanish torpedo boats were sunk before
their guns would bear. The Americans
were greatly superior in everything that goes
to win victory; but that they did not know
until the fight had been going on for some
time; and as Commodore Dewey led his fleet
along the coast of Luzon, toward the harbor
where he knew the enemy lay in wait for them,
he had nothing less than a desperate battle
to expect. The Americans were brave; we
know of no cowardice among them, but to the
thoughtful ones&mdash;Max Raymond among them&mdash;it
was a solemn reflection that they might
be nearing mutilation and sudden, painful
death. The Spanish ships were anchored in
a harbor protected by shore batteries. To
reach them the Americans must pass down a
channel sixteen miles long, guarded on each
side by powerful forts armed with modern
guns; and it was to be expected that it held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
many mines prepared to blow up our
vessels.</p>

<p>Knowing all these things, Commodore
Dewey, his officers, and his men must have been
expecting a hard fight, with no certainty of
winning the victory. There was probably but
little sleep on board the vessel that night.
About ten o'clock Saturday night the men
were sent to their stations for battle.</p>

<p>Max had spent some leisure time in writing
to the dear ones in his home, and the still
dearer one pledged to become his wife, telling
just where he was and the prospect immediately
before him, expressing his hope
that all would go well with the Americans&mdash;now
championing the cause of the poor, oppressed
Cubans and of these downtrodden
Filipinos&mdash;and that he would be able to
write further after the conflict ended, should
he pass safely through it; but if he should be
killed or seriously wounded, doubtless the news
would reach them in due season, and they must
think of him as having fallen in a good cause,
hoping to meet them all in a better land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>A little before that, the commodore was
walking back and forth on the starboard side
of the upper deck, when he noticed an old
sailor who seemed to be trying to find something
to do on the port side. He was a man
who had been forty years in the service of
the navy and army of the United States, and
was a privileged character on the <i>Olympia</i>.
He seemed to be keeping a careful lookout on
the commodore, who noticed it and perceived
that he had something on his mind.</p>

<p>"Well, Purdy, what is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>Purdy straightened up and saluted. "I
hope, sir," he said, "ye don't intend to fight on
the 3d of May."</p>

<p>"And why not?" asked the commodore.</p>

<p>"Well, ye see, sir," Purdy replied, in the
most serious manner, "the last time I fought
on the 3d of May I got licked&mdash;at the
battle of Chancellorsville, under Fighting
Joe Hooker."</p>

<p>"All right, Purdy, we won't fight on the 3d
of May this time," said the commodore; "but
when we do fight, Purdy, you'll have a different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
kind of a May anniversary to think about.
Remember that, Purdy."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir," replied Purdy, saluting, then
hurrying away to rejoin his blue jacket comrades,
whom he told, "We'll lick those Spaniards
if they was ten times as many as they
are."</p>

<p>The moon was in its first quarter, and
though often veiled by clouds its light might
enable the Spaniards on the fortified points
here and there to perceive the stealthy approach
of their foe. Max, on the watch with
others, overheard the commodore say, as they
neared the opening between Mariveles and
the Island of Corregidor, "We ought to hear
from this battery about now."</p>

<p>But its guns were silent. They went on two
miles further without perceiving any evidence
that the Spaniards were awake and aware of
their approach.</p>

<p>"They seem far from alert and watchful,"
Max presently remarked. But at that moment
a bright light was thrown on the Point,
an answering one was seen on the island, as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
they were signalling each other, then a rocket
soared up from the centre of Corregidor, and
the commodore said, "It has taken them a
long time to wake up, but probably they will
make it all the hotter for us when they
begin."</p>

<p>Day had not yet dawned when they reached
the mouth of Manila Bay. They did not stop
to reconnoitre, but pressed on at once, running
the gantlet of batteries and concealed mines
without waiting for daylight to make it easier.</p>

<p>They waited a little for the setting of the
moon, then went on in single file, the <i>Olympia</i>
leading and the <i>McCulloch</i> bringing up the
rear, and with no lights except one lantern at
the stern of each ship for the next to steer by.</p>

<p>A great light marked the entrance to the
harbor, gleaming in the darkness as though to
welcome the gray ships stealing so quietly in,
as if to come suddenly and unexpectedly upon
their prey. The forts were as silent as
though all their defenders were asleep or
dead. That was a wonder to the Americans,
for the rush of their vessels through the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
seemed to make a sound that might be heard
by the enemy, and every moment they expected
it to attract their attention; and so
anxious were they to pass unnoticed, that they
spoke to each other in whispers, and moved
about with muffled tread. They were in momentary
expectation of a cannon shot or the
explosion of a mine that might rend the plates
of some one of their ships; but nothing of
either kind occurred, until the last ship in the
procession&mdash;the <i>McCulloch</i>&mdash;gave the first
alarm. Coal was flung on her furnace, and a
red flame flared up, lighting up the waters and
the rigging of the ship itself and of those
ahead. All the men on the fleet turned expectantly
toward the batteries on the land,
thinking that shots would certainly come now.
But all was silence there. Again and again
the unlucky beacon flared, and after the
third time it was noticed by the flash of a gun
on a rock called El Fraile. But the aim was
not good, and the shot did not strike any of
our vessels. The <i>Concord</i> fired in return, and
cannon roared from the <i>Boston</i>, the <i>McCulloch</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and again from the <i>Concord</i>, but the <i>Olympia</i>
and other big ships passed on in silent
dignity.</p>

<p>The commodore was standing on the bridge
of the <i>Olympia</i>, piloting his fleet, and the shot
from El Fraile had given him a clear idea of
how the shore lay. And now, having passed
that battery, all the defences of the harbor's
mouth were left behind, and excepting mines
that might lie concealed under the water there
was no further danger to meet until they
should reach the city with its forts at Cavité.</p>

<p>As the ship steamed on up the bay, Max and
Dale standing together on deck fell into conversation.</p>

<p>"What ails these Spaniards?" queried
Dale. "I, for one, expected nothing less than
a severe fight at the very mouth of this bay,
but they have let us come in and on up toward
their city almost unnoticed. The strait
where we came in is only about five miles wide,
and broken by three islands, all fortified, and
armed with Krupp guns. And on the mainland
there are two forts&mdash;one on each side&mdash;which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
as I have been told, are armed with steel
rifled cannon."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Max, "and we passed them all
within easy range, and received only ineffective
fire from one battery. But this is only the beginning;
at any minute we may come in contact
with a mine in the channel which will explode,
or an electric mine may be discharged in
a way to work us serious mischief."</p>

<p>"True enough," said Dale; "and it behooves
us to be ready for the worst. There will probably
be men killed and wounded on both sides."</p>

<p>"Yes," sighed Max; "war is an awful thing;
but in this instance right is on our side, because
we have undertaken the cause of the oppressed.
And," he added with an effort, "if we have
made our peace with God&mdash;are believing in
the Lord Jesus Christ and trusting in his perfect
righteousness&mdash;death will be no calamity
to us; and if we are wounded, no matter how
painfully, he will give us strength to bear it."</p>

<p>"I do not doubt it," said Dale; "nor that
you are in that state of preparation, Raymond.
I hope I am also; and that being the case, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
surely can go bravely on to meet whatever
awaits us."</p>

<p>"I hope so," said Max, "and believing, as I
do, that we are in the right, I have a strong
hope that God will give us the victory."</p>

<p>"Ah, see!" cried a voice near them, "yonder
are the Spanish ships, lying at anchor
under the batteries at Cavité."</p>

<p>"Yes," said another, "and there is the old
town of Manila, with its low clustering roofs
and towering cathedral."</p>

<p>Men crowded to the best points from which
to obtain a good view, and stood in silence
gazing upon it. Max had a glass, and looking
through it could see the roofs and quays
of the city crowded with spectators. Evidently
the engagement with the battery at El
Fraile had been heard and had alarmed the
city.</p>

<p>Dewey had planned for a prompt fight, but
did not intend to have his men go into it hungry;
and now some of his sailors were passing
up and down distributing cups of hot coffee
and biscuits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>That duly attended to, signals fluttered
from the gaff, black balls were run up to every
peak on all the vessels, and, breaking out, displayed
the great battle flags. At that, some
nine-inch guns on Fort Lunette were fired&mdash;without
doing any damage&mdash;and the American
vessels suddenly moved on to closer quarters.</p>

<p>"Hold your fire!" was the order from the
flagship, and two shots from the <i>Concord</i> was
the only answer given to the forts. Onward
the fleet sped toward that of the Spaniards,
which was silent also. Suddenly there was a
muffled roar, and a great volume of mud and
water was thrown into the air right before the
flagship, showing that the dreaded mines were
near. In an instant there was another explosion,
but neither did any harm; and they were
all our men saw of the Spanish explosives of
that sort.</p>

<p>Now the fleet was nearing the enemy. On
the <i>Olympia's</i> bridge stood Commodore Dewey,
with Captain Gridley and Flag-captain Lamberton
at his side. The Spanish ships now
joined the forts in pouring their fire on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
advancing foe, but still there was no response.
Presently the sun rose red and glaring with
midsummer heat, and at that the commodore,
turning to the officer at his side, said quietly,
"You may fire now, Gridley, when ready."</p>

<p>Gridley was ready, and the next instant an
eight-inch shell was on its way toward the
enemy, who was only about 4500 yards distant.
Presently a signal from the flagship
gave the same permission to the other vessels,
and the whole fleet was engaged.</p>

<p>Shortly before that, Dewey had assembled
the men of the <i>Olympia</i> and given them this
final direction for their conduct during the
fight: "Keep perfectly cool, and pay attention
to nothing but orders." Such was the watchword
through his whole fleet that morning,
and the result was a deliberate and deadly fire.
The ships steamed along in regular order&mdash;the
<i>Olympia</i>, the <i>Baltimore</i>, the <i>Raleigh</i>, <i>Petrel</i>,
<i>Concord</i>, and <i>Boston</i>&mdash;parallel to the Spanish
ships, working every gun that could be brought
to bear, and receiving the fire of ships and
forts in return. The fire of the Spanish guns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
was a succession of brilliant misses&mdash;shots that
came very near hitting, but did not quite do
so. It was, as Dewey put it in his report,
"vigorous, but generally ineffective."</p>

<p>But the aim was not always bad. One shell
struck the gratings of the bridge of the
<i>Olympia</i>; one narrowly missed the commodore
himself, and so hot did the fire become that
he bade Captain Gridley go into the conning
tower lest both of them might be killed or disabled
at once. On the <i>Boston</i> a six-inch gun
was disabled, and a box of ammunition exploded.
Also a shell burst in a stateroom, and
set it on fire. Our six vessels steamed along
down past the Spanish line, the port side of
every ship a mass of flame and smoke, then
circling around in a grand sweep&mdash;that made
the Spaniards think for a moment they were
pulling out of action&mdash;the column returned
again on its course, and the men of the starboard
batteries had a chance to try their skill
while their fellows rested. They had made this
circuit but three times when three of the
Spanish ships were on fire. Looking through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
glasses the shots could be seen striking the
Spanish hulls, which were thinly plated.</p>

<p>Admiral Montojo, stung into fury by his
losses, slipped the cables of his flagship, just as
the Americans were beginning their third
round, and under full steam darted out as if
intending to attack the <i>Olympia</i>. But as his
vessel&mdash;the <i>Reina Christina</i>&mdash;swung away
from her fellows the fire of the whole American
fleet was concentrated upon her. The
storm of shot and shell came pouring down
upon her, pierced her hull like paper, swept her
decks and spread death and destruction on
every side. Her engines were pierced, her
bridge shot away. She could hardly be controlled
by her helm, and as she turned her
stern to the American fire an eight-inch gun
on the <i>Olympia</i> sent a projectile that struck
her there, tore its way forward, exploding ammunition,
shattering guns, killing men, piercing
partitions, tearing up decks, and finally
exploding in her after-boiler.</p>

<p>Agonized screams of wounded men were
heard rising above the thunder of the battle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and the <i>Reina Christina</i> staggered back with
flames leaping from her hatches.</p>

<p>While this was going on the two Spanish
torpedo boats slipped out and ran for the
American fleet. One hastened toward the
supply ships, but was caught by the <i>Petrel</i>,
driven ashore, and fired upon until she blew
up. The other, running for the <i>Olympia</i>, was
struck by a shell, broke in two, and sank out of
sight.</p>

<p>Five times the circuit was made by the
American ships; then a signal fluttered from
the yard of the <i>Olympia</i>, and the fleet turned
away to the other side of the harbor, where
the <i>McCulloch</i> and the colliers had been
lying.</p>

<p>At that the Spaniards, supposing the Americans
were retreating, raised a resounding cheer.
The men on the American ships were not so
well pleased. They were asking what this
move was for, and when told that it was in
order to give them their breakfast, there was
much grumbling.</p>

<p>"Breakfast!" exclaimed one of the gunners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
"who wants any breakfast? Why can't we
finish off the Dons, now we've got them
going?"</p>

<p>But breakfast was not what the delay was
for. A misunderstood signal had made the
commodore fear that the supply of ammunition
for the five-inch guns on board of some of
the vessels was running low, and he wished to
replenish their stock. It was found, however,
not to be necessary. But officers and sailors
had their breakfast and a three hours' rest,
during which guns and machinery that had
been used in that morning's fight were examined
and a supply of fresh ammunition was
prepared. Then the signals for a renewal
of the battle were given, and the ships again
bore down upon the enemy, revolving as before
in a great circle of smoke and fire, but at
closer range than at first.</p>

<p>The Spaniards seemed desperate, fired
wildly, and in a half-hearted way. The <i>Reina
Christina</i> was blown up by the shells of the
<i>Baltimore</i>; quickly after the <i>Don Juan de
Austria</i> was destroyed by the <i>Raleigh</i>, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
on till all of the ten Spanish ships had been
destroyed or had surrendered.</p>

<p>Admiral Montojo had transferred his flag to
the <i>Isla de Cuba</i>, and fought till her guns
were silenced and she was in flames; then leaving
her to her fate, he escaped to the city. It
is said that a great crowd of people had come
out from that city that morning to see "the
pigs of Yankees" annihilated.</p>

<p>The last ship left fighting was the <i>Don
Antonio de Ulloa</i>, and at length she sank, with
her flag still nailed to her mast. One of the
American shots entered the magazine at Cavité,
and that ended the resistance of the shore
batteries. Then from the <i>Olympia</i> was flung
out the signal, "The enemy has surrendered,"
the hot, weary, smoke-begrimed men swarmed
cheering out of turrets and up from the bowels
of the ships, and the flagship's band broke out
with the "Star Spangled Banner," for the victory
of Manila was won, the first victory of the
war with Spain for the help of the sorely oppressed
Cubans.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Max</span> had done bravely and well, and no one
rejoiced more keenly in the victory than he,
though his heart bled for the wounded and
slain. He as well as others listened eagerly
for the accounts of the captains of the other
vessels of the fleet as they came on board to
report to the commodore.</p>

<p>"How many killed?" was demanded of each
one, as he stepped on the deck, and great was
the surprise and satisfaction on learning that
none had been killed.</p>

<p>"Only eight wounded, none seriously," was
the reply of Captain Dyer of the <i>Baltimore</i>.
"But six shells struck us, and two burst inboard
without hurting any one."</p>

<p>"Not a dashed one," was the next captain's
answer. "None killed and none wounded,"
said the third, "but I don't yet know how it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
happened. I suppose you fellows were all cut
up."</p>

<p>"My ship wasn't hit at all," was the next report.</p>

<p>It was known that the <i>Boston</i> had been on
fire, therefore it was expected that her captain
would have to report a serious list of casualties,
and when he announced that no one had
been killed or wounded on his vessel the news
spread quickly through the flagship, and the
men cheered vociferously. The <i>Baltimore</i>
had been struck by a sixty-pound projectile,
fired from a land battery. It struck the ship
about two feet above the upper deck, between
two guns which were being served; pierced two
plates of steel each one-quarter of an inch
thick; then ploughed through the wooden deck,
striking and breaking a heavy beam, by which
it was turned upward; then it passed through a
steel hatch-combing; disabled a six-inch gun;
hurtled around the semicircular shield which
surrounded the gun, missing the men at it; reversed
its course and travelled back to a point
almost opposite that at which it had entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the ship, and thus passed out. It had passed
between men crowded at their quarters and
had touched none, but it exploded some loose
ammunition, by which eight were wounded.</p>

<p>Max listened to the accounts of the almost
bloodless victory with a heart swelling with
gratitude to God, and full of hope for the
success of America's effort to free the victims
of Spanish cruelty and oppression. What glad
tidings his next letter would carry to the dear
ones at home. They would rejoice over the
victory, and his safety too, though that might
be again imperilled at any time.</p>

<p>This naval battle had been fought on Sunday.
On Monday morning Captain Lamberton
went on shore to receive the formal surrender
of the fort at Cavité. They had hauled down
their flag the day before, but now tried to
prove that they had never done so. Perceiving
that, the captain drew out his watch. Before
leaving his ship he had directed that unless he
returned in an hour those works should be
bombarded. Forty-five minutes of that hour
were now gone, and he said to the Spaniards:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
"Unless you surrender unconditionally so
soon that I can get back to my ship in fifteen
minutes, the <i>Petrel</i> will open fire on your
works."</p>

<p>That had the desired effect; they surrendered
at once, and priests and nuns came
humbly to beg him to restrain his men from
murdering all the wounded in the hospitals.
They had been told that that was the invariable
practice of the barbarous "Yanquis."</p>

<p>The next day the <i>Raleigh</i> and <i>Baltimore</i>
went down to the mouth of the bay and, after a
brief attack, captured the forts on Corregidor
and Sangley Point. The guns in these works
were destroyed by wrapping them with gun
cotton and exploding it with electricity. The
officer in command at Corregidor went aboard
the <i>Raleigh</i> to surrender himself, and while
there seemed greatly alarmed to find the ship
drifting in the main channel, or Boca Grand,
and demanded that he be at once put ashore.
Asked the reason of his alarm and haste to get
away, he said the channel was full of contact
mines, and though the Americans might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
satisfied to brave death by them he was not,
and it was not fair to expose a prisoner to almost
certain destruction. And that was the
channel through which the American fleet had
entered the harbor.</p>

<p>Four days after his victory Dewey, having
all the harbor defences at his command, sent
off the <i>McCulloch</i> to Hong-Kong with his first
despatches to Washington. So a week had
passed after the rumors from Madrid before
the American people received definite information
in regard to Dewey's successes in the
Philippines. These are the despatches:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Manila</span>, May 1.&mdash;Squadron arrived at Manila at
daybreak this morning. Immediately engaged the
enemy and destroyed following Spanish vessels: <i>Reina
Cristina</i>, <i>Castilla</i>, <i>Don Antonio de Ulloa</i>, <i>Isla de Luzon</i>,
<i>Isla de Cuba</i>, <i>General Lezo</i>, <i>Marques del Duoro</i>, <i>El Correo</i>,
<i>Velasco</i>, <i>Isla de Mindanao</i>, a transport, and water battery
at Cavité. The squadron is uninjured, and only a
few men are slightly wounded. Only means of telegraphing
is to American consul at Hong-Kong. I shall
communicate with him.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><span class="smcap">Dewey.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Manila</span>, May 4.&mdash;I have taken possession of the
naval station at Cavité, Philippine Islands, and destroyed
the fortifications. Have destroyed fortifications at bay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
entrance, Corregidor Island, parolling the garrison. I
control the bay completely, and can take the city at
any time. The squadron is in excellent health and
spirits. The Spanish loss not fully known, but is very
heavy. One hundred and fifty killed, including captain,
on <i>Reina Cristina</i> alone. I am assisting in protecting
Spanish sick and wounded. Two hundred and fifty
sick and wounded in hospital within our lines. Much
excitement in Manila. Will protect foreign residents.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><span class="smcap">Dewey.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A message of congratulation from the
President and people of the United States was
the immediate response to Dewey's despatches,
and with it the information that the President
had appointed the victorious commander a
rear-admiral. Doubtless a rumor concerning
the nature of that despatch quickly reached all
the vessels of the fleet, for the next morning
watchful eyes on many of them turned to the
flagship to see what flag would be run up to
the mainmast, and when they saw that it was
a blue flag as of yore, but had two stars instead
of one, the guns of the squadron roared out a
salute to the new admiral. No one there was
more rejoiced than Max, who both respected
and loved his gallant commander; and no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
in America felt happier over the good news in
Dewey's despatches than those to whom Max
was so dear. It was a blessed relief to their
anxiety to learn that no one in the squadron
had been killed, and none more than slightly
wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> news of the destruction of the <i>Maine</i>
was quite as exciting to our friends at Ion as
to those of Woodburn. All saw that war between
the United States and Spain could not
be long delayed, and when it was declared, both
Harold and Herbert Travilla volunteered their
services as physicians and surgeons to the
troops to be sent to Cuba or Puerto Rico.
Their mother gave consent, though her heart
bled at thought of the toils and dangers they
would be called upon to endure, but she felt
that they were right in their desire to help the
poor Cubans to such freedom as we enjoy.
No one had felt a deeper sympathy for the despoiled
and starving reconcentradoes than she.
Her sons were not going as soldiers, to be sure,
but as greatly needed help to those who were
to do the fighting.</p>

<p>Captain Raymond was strongly inclined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
offer his services to the government, but was
deterred by the earnest, tearful entreaties of
his wife and daughters. They urged him to
refrain, for their sakes, as there seemed to be
no lack of men who could be better spared&mdash;at
least so it seemed to them.</p>

<p>"Oh, father," said Grace, "don't think of
such a thing! There are plenty of other men
who are not so much loved and needed in their
own homes; so that the poor Cubans will be
sure to get free without our risking the loss of
the dearest father that anybody ever had."</p>

<p>It was shortly after breakfast on a beautiful
May morning, and the whole family were together
on the front veranda, the captain occupying
an easy chair, while looking over the
morning paper. Grace had come close to his
side, and was standing there as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Is that your opinion of him?" he asked,
smiling up into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; and always has been," she answered,
accepting a silent invitation to a seat
upon his knee, and putting an arm around his
neck. "Oh, father, I don't know how I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
live without you!" she exclaimed, her eyes
filling with tears at the very thought.</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Lucilla. "No greater calamity
than the loss of our father could possibly
befall us. And there are plenty of other
people to look after the Cubans."</p>

<p>"So I think," said Violet. "If our country
was in peril it would be a different matter.
And, my dear, as your eldest son is in the fight&mdash;such
a dear fellow as he is too!&mdash;I am sure
that ought to be considered your full share of
giving and doing for the Cuban cause."</p>

<p>"I should think so indeed!" chimed in
Lucilla and Grace in a breath.</p>

<p>"And, oh, I can't bear to think that my
dear brother Max may get wounded!" exclaimed
Elsie; and Ned added, "And if he
does, I'd just like to shoot the fellow that
shoots him."</p>

<p>"We must try not to feel revengeful, my
little son," said his father.</p>

<p>"Well, papa, please promise not to offer to
go into the fight," pleaded Grace, and the
others all added their earnest solicitations to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
hers, till at length they won the desired pledge.
They were too dear to the captain's heart to be
denied what they pleaded for so earnestly and
importunately.</p>

<p>Grace was feebler and oftener ailing that
spring than she had been for several years before,
and Dr. Arthur Conly, or one or the
other of his partners,&mdash;Harold and Herbert
Travilla,&mdash;was often there to give advice and
see that it was followed. It had been Harold
oftener, of late, than any one else, and he had
grown very fond of the sweet girl who always
listened with such deference to his advice, and
called him "uncle" in her sweet voice. The
thought of leaving her gave him a keener pang
than anything else, as he contemplated leaving
his home for the labors and dangers of the
seat of war. He was glad indeed when he
learned that the captain would remain at home
to take care of her and the rest of his
family.</p>

<p>Grace noticed with pleasure that as the time
of his leaving drew near his manner toward her
grew more affectionate, till it seemed almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
as tender as that of her father, and she thought
it very nice that Uncle Harold should be so
fond of her. She looked up to him as one
who was very wise and good, and wondered
that he should care particularly for her, as she
was not really related to him at all. He was
fond of Lucilla also, but Grace seemed to him
the lovelier of the two. He had always been
fond of her, but did not know until about to
leave her for that dangerous field of usefulness
that his affection was of the sort to make him
long for her as the partner of his life. But so
it was. Yet could it be? Would the captain
ever consent to such a mixture of relationships?
He feared not; and at all events it was
quite certain that he would not be allowed to
try to win his coveted prize for years to come&mdash;she
being so young, and far from strong and
well. Then as he was about to risk his life on
battlefields, it would be cruelty to her to try
to win her love before he went.</p>

<p>He resolved to go without revealing his
secret to any one. But he had never had an
important secret from his mother; all his life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
he had been used to talking freely with her,
telling of his hopes, aims, and wishes, his
doubts and perplexities, and almost before he
knew it he had said enough of his feelings for
Grace to show to that mother's keen-sighted
affection how the land lay.</p>

<p>"Grace is very lovely, and a dear child," she
said low and gently; "but, as you know, she is
not well or strong. Also she is so young that
her father would not hear of her marrying for
years to come."</p>

<p>"No, mother, nor would I advise it; unless,"
he added with a low, embarrassed laugh, "to a
physician who would take special care of her
health."</p>

<p>"You refer to one physician in particular, I
perceive," returned his mother, with a low,
musical laugh, and laying her hand in his, for
they were sitting side by side on the veranda.
"Well, my dear boy. I advise you to wait till
your return home before you say anything to
either her or her father. But have you thought
what a mixture of relationships such a marriage
would make? Your brother-in-law would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
be also your father-in-law, and Grace aunt to
her half-brother and sister."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, it would cause some awkward
relationships; but as there is no tie of blood
between us, perhaps that need not matter. But
I shall say nothing till I come home, and not
then without the captain's permission."</p>

<p>"That is right. But do you think Grace
suspects?"</p>

<p>"Hardly, mother; I am only her 'uncle,'
you know," Harold answered, with a laugh in
which there was little or no mirth.</p>

<p>"Although I am certainly very fond of
Grace," said his mother, "I cannot help regretting
that your affections have not gone out
to some one else rather than to her&mdash;because of
her feeble health and the connection through
your sister and her father."</p>

<p>"Yes, they are objections," he returned,
with a sigh; "but mother dear, you will not
consider them insuperable if I can persuade
the captain not to do so?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! not if you win, or have won, her
heart. I should not think of raising the least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
objection, and surely the captain, who is a devoted
father, would not, should he see that her
affections are engaged."</p>

<p>"That is my hope," said Harold; "and, as I
have said, I do not intend to offer myself without
his knowledge and consent, though I had
hard work to refrain to-day when Grace and I
were left alone together for a few minutes, and
she expressed, with tears in her sweet blue
eyes, such anxiety at the thought of my being
in danger of wounds or death in the coming
struggle in Cuba. Mother dear, Herbert and
I will not, of course, be in as great danger as
will the fighting men of our army and navy,
but there is a possibility that we may not return
unharmed, and in case I should not I
would not have Grace know of my love and intention
to&mdash;ask her to become my wife."</p>

<p>"I think you are right, my son," his mother
said, with emotion. "But, ah, I hope and shall
pray constantly that my dear boys may come
back to me unharmed."</p>

<p>"And it will be a great help and comfort to
them to know that their dear mother's prayers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
are following them," rejoined Harold, tenderly
pressing the hand she had laid in his.</p>

<p>The next moment Herbert joined them, and
he too had a farewell talk with his mother, for
the brothers were to leave for Tampa the next
morning to join the troops about to sail for
Cuba.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the last of May there were sixteen thousand
men at Tampa under the command of
General Shafter, but it was not until the 14th
of June that they set sail for Cuba. On a
clear, scorchingly hot morning, June 22d, they
landed at Daiquiri, twelve miles east of the
entrance to Santiago Bay. From all accounts
things seem to have been wofully mismanaged,
so that our poor soldiers had no
facilities for landing. Those who loaded the
ship, it would appear, must have been great
bunglers&mdash;either exceedingly ignorant in regard
to such work or most reprehensibly careless.
In consequence, scarcely anything could
be found when wanted. Medical stores were
scattered among twenty vessels; so that when
fever broke out in the trenches before Santiago
it was almost impossible to get the needed
remedies; probably&mdash;though there were never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
enough on the field&mdash;some medicines were left
on the ships and carried back to the United
States. All this made the work of the physicians
doubly trying. Besides, they were too
few in number, the wounded many more than it
had been expected they would be, and brought
in faster than they could be attended to; the
surgeons worked all night by the light of spluttering
lamps, and there was not enough of even
surgical instruments. But the poor wounded
men were wonderfully brave and patient.
Harold and Herbert Travilla felt that they had
not engaged in a cause which did not need
them. After the fighting began their labors
were exhausting; all the more so because of the
drain upon their sympathies.</p>

<p>On the morning of July 2d our troops were
found safely intrenched on the ridge of the
hill above Santiago. The day before had been
one of heavy losses to our army&mdash;many officers
and men killed and wounded. And now, just
as light began to show in the east, the Spaniards
opened a heavy fire on our works. Our
men made few replies, for ammunition was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
getting scarce; and so anxious for it were the
soldiers that they hailed an ammunition train
with great joy, though they were half starved
and knew that no provisions could come while
the road was crowded with such trains.</p>

<p>The war artist, Frederic Remington, tells
of the delight with which the poor hungry fellows
hailed a pack-train loaded with ammunition,
though they knew that no food would be
brought them that night. "The wounded
going to the rear cheered the ammunition,
and when it was unpacked at the front the
soldiers seized it like gold. They lifted a box
in the air and dropped it on one corner, which
smashed it open.</p>

<p>"'Now we can hold San Juan hill against
them garlics; hey, son?' yelled a happy cavalryman
to a doughboy.</p>

<p>"'You bet! until we starve to death.'</p>

<p>"'Starve nothin'&mdash;we'll eat them gun-teams.'"</p>

<p>The soldiers refilled their cartridge belts,
then crouched all day in trenches, watching for
an assault, and firing just often enough to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the enemy from advancing upon them. While
doing so they could hear the thunder of the
navy's guns far away in the southwest, where
it was engaging a battery. At the same time,
down in the harbor of Santiago, Cervera was
getting ready to make his rush out of the harbor
the next day.</p>

<p>The Spaniards made a dash at our men about
half-past nine that night, and drove them
back for a few minutes from several points on
their line, but they soon returned and drove
the Spaniards back with heavy loss.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next day, July 3d, was Sunday, and on
the great ships of the American squadron,
floating heavily in a half-circle about the
mouth of Santiago harbor, the men were
swarming on deck in fresh clean white clothes,
ready for muster. About nine o'clock the
flagship <i>New York</i> showed the signal: "Disregard
flagship's movements," and steamed
away toward the east. Admiral Sampson had
gone in it for a conference with General
Shafter, whose troops were then resting after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
their dreadful fight on San Juan hill and El
Caney.</p>

<p>Of our ships on watch outside of the harbor,
the <i>Brooklyn</i> was to the southwest, the <i>Texas</i>
directly south, while the three big battleships,
<i>Indiana</i>, <i>Iowa</i>, and <i>Oregon</i>, made a curve inshore
east of the Morro. The little picket
boat <i>Vixen</i> was there also, and the <i>Gloucester</i>
farthest east and nearest inshore. The <i>New
York</i>, now absent, was the one ship supposed
to be able to compete with the Spaniards in
speed, and her departure left a broad gap in
the blockading line.</p>

<p>The lookouts on the fleet had reported fires
burning on the hills all the night before, and
Commodore Schley, who was in command in
Admiral Sampson's absence, signalled to the
<i>Texas</i> the query: "What is your theory about
the burning of the block-houses on the hill last
night?"</p>

<p>He sat on the deck waiting for an answer,
and at the same time watching a cloud of
smoke rising from the interior of the harbor
behind the hills. It did not necessarily mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
anything serious, for about that time in the
morning a tug was apt to make a visit to the
Estrella battery. Still, they watched it, and
presently the quartermaster on the forward
bridge said quietly to the navigating officer,
"That smoke's moving, sir." That officer
took a peep himself, and what he saw nearly
made him drop the glass. "Afterbridge
there," he called loudly through a megaphone;
"tell the commodore the enemy is coming
out."</p>

<p>His words were heard all over the ship, and
commodore, officers, sailors, powder-boys were
all rushing for their station.</p>

<p>The cry rang out, "Clear ship for action,"
and gongs and bugles which call to general
quarters clanged and pealed on the quiet air.
There were echoes of the same sounds from
the other ships, and the signals, "The enemy is
escaping," ran to the masthead of the <i>Brooklyn</i>,
the <i>Texas</i>, and the <i>Iowa</i> at the same moment;
for that suspicious smoke had been
watched from all the ships.</p>

<p>It seemed that all the vessels of the blockade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
had caught the alarm at the same time, and the
flagship's signal was quickly changed for another&mdash;"Clear
ship for action!"</p>

<p>But it was quite unnecessary. On every
ship men were dropping off the white clothes
which they had donned for general muster,
and hurrying to their quarters without waiting
for a command. Every wooden thing was
tumbled overboard, water-tight compartments
were hastily shut, hose was coupled up and
strung along the decks ready to fight fire,
battle-hatches were lowered, and in less time
than it takes to tell of it all this was accomplished.
Then at the sudden blast of a bugle
the five hundred and more men to a ship stood
at their posts, each one where he would
be most needed in battle, and all perfectly
silent. Doubtless every eye was turned toward
Estrella Point, where the Spanish vessels, if
indeed coming out, must first show themselves,
and there presently a huge black hull appeared.
It came out far enough to show a turret, and
from that came a flash, and then the boom of
a heavy shot, instantly answered by a six-pounder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
from the <i>Iowa</i>. The battle had begun,
and "Fighting Bob" Evans had fired the
first shot.</p>

<p>That ship just coming out was the <i>Maria
Teresa</i>, and she was followed by the <i>Vizcaya</i>,
the <i>Cristobal Colon</i>, and the <i>Almirante
Oquendo</i>. All the American ships were standing
in toward the harbor to meet them, firing
rapidly from every gun that could be brought
to bear. It was uncertain at first which way the
Spaniards would turn when they had passed
the shoals that extend half a mile beyond the
mouth of the harbor. If they turned eastward
they would have to run into the midst of the
most formidable ships of our squadron. If
they went directly west they might outrun the
battleships and escape. The <i>Brooklyn</i> was the
fastest ship on the blockade, and was also in
the best position to head off the Spaniards
should they take that course. But it was possible
she might be lost, as she was no match
for the number of the enemy that would be in
a position to engage her when she came up to
them. Commodore Schley says that the possibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
of losing his ship in that way entered
very clearly into his calculations, but also that
in sinking the <i>Brooklyn</i> the Spaniards would
be delayed long enough for the battleships to
come up to them and that then there would be
no reason to fear their escape. The difficulty
was that because the <i>Brooklyn</i> was on a parallel
course with the Spaniards, and going in a
directly opposite direction, she would have to
make a complete circle in order to chase them;
and had they had the speed with which they
were credited, that would have put the <i>Brooklyn</i>
out of the fight, one of her engines being
uncoupled, and in consequence her speed
greatly reduced.</p>

<p>But the Spanish vessels fell far behind their
estimated speed, so that the <i>Brooklyn</i> was able
to circle about and still overhaul the fleetest
of them, and the <i>Texas</i>, the slowest of our
battleships, held its own in the race.</p>

<p>The <i>Maria Teresa</i> passed the shoals and
turned west. The little <i>Vixen</i>, lying near the
<i>Brooklyn</i>, when she saw the <i>Maria Teresa</i> turn
toward her, fired off her six-pounders, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
slipped away, while the rest of the American
ships came rushing down toward the enemy
with their funnels belching black smoke, and
turrets, hulls, and tops spurting out red flames
and yellow smoke. They steamed toward the
foe as fast as possible, at the same time firing
fiercely from every gun that could be brought
to bear, and paying no attention to the shore
batteries which were firing upon them. The
<i>Indiana</i> was nearest the shore and nearest the
<i>Maria Teresa</i>, the leading ship of the enemy,
when the fight began. It is said that the water
fairly boiled with the flood of projectiles from
Morro and the broadside with which the <i>Maria
Teresa</i> opened battle. As she turned toward
the west the shot from the <i>Indiana</i> struck her
more than once; but after that the <i>Indiana</i>
gave her attention to the <i>Vizcaya</i>.</p>

<p>By this time all the American ships were
engaged, but in the dense smoke it was almost
impossible to make out how great was the success
of any single one.</p>

<p>But Commodore Eaton, who was watching
the fight from the tug <i>Resolute</i>, says: "As the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
<i>Vizcaya</i> came out I distinctly saw one of the
<i>Indiana's</i> heavy shells strike her abaft the
funnels, and the explosion of this shell was
followed by a burst of flame, which for a time
obscured the after part of the stricken ship."
The <i>Iowa</i> and <i>Oregon</i>, belching forth great
clouds of smoke until they looked like huge
yellow clouds on the water, steamed straight
toward the fleeing enemy. Says Mr. Abbott:
"As the battleships closed in on their prey,
they overlapped each other, and careless use
of the guns or failure to make out accurately
the target might have resulted in one of our
ships firing into another. But so skilfully
were they handled that at no time were they
put in jeopardy from either the guns or the
rams of each other, though at one time the
<i>Oregon</i> was firing right across the deck of the
<i>Texas</i>."</p>

<p>The end of the <i>Maria Teresa</i>, the first ship
to leave the harbor, came upon her very swiftly,
and was frightful. The shells and small projectiles
searched out every part of her, spreading
death and ruin, and soon setting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
her woodwork ablaze. The scarlet flames
like snakes' tongues darted viciously from her
sides; but her gunners stood manfully to their
guns. Little smoke hung about her, and her
bold black hulk seen against the green background
of the hills made her a perfect target.
A shot from the <i>Brooklyn</i> cut her main water-pipe,
and a shell&mdash;probably from the <i>Oregon</i>&mdash;entered
her hull and exploded in the engine
room; a six-inch shell from the <i>Iowa</i> exploded
in her forward turret, killing or wounding
every man at the guns; while the storm of
smaller projectiles swept her decks, and with
the noise of their bursting made it impossible
for the men to hear their officers' commands.</p>

<p>Admiral Cervera was on that vessel. One of
his officers, telling of it afterward, said: "He
expected to lose most of his ships, but thought
the <i>Cristobal Colon</i> might escape; that is why
he transferred his flag to the <i>Maria Teresa</i>,
that he might perish with the less fortunate."
And this is the story told an American journalist
by another officer who stood by the admiral's
side while that dreadful fight went on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Of a shell from the <i>Brooklyn</i> he said: "It
struck us in the bow, ploughing down amidships;
then it exploded. It tore down the
bulkheads, destroyed stanchions, crippled two
rapid-fire guns, and killed fifteen or twenty
men." Of a shell from the <i>Iowa</i> he said: "It
struck the eleven-inch gun in the forward
turret of the cruiser, cutting a furrow as clean
as a knife out of the gun. The shell exploded
halfway in the turret, making the whole vessel
stagger and shake in every plate. When the
fumes and smoke had cleared away so that it
was possible to enter the turret, the other gunners
were sent there. The survivors tumbled
the bodies which filled the wrecked turret
through the ammunition hoist to the lower
deck. Even the machinery was clogged with
corpses. All our rapid-fire guns aloft soon
became silent, because every gunner had been
either killed or crippled at his post and lay on
the deck where he fell. There were so many
wounded that the surgeons ceased trying to
dress the wounds. Shells had exploded inside
the ship, and even the hospital was turned into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
a furnace. The first wounded who were sent
there had to be abandoned by the surgeons,
who fled for their lives from the intolerable
heat."</p>

<p>The <i>Teresa</i> came under the fire of our guns
about 9.35 that morning. Fifteen minutes
later smoke was rising from her ports and
hatches, showing that she had been set afire by
the American shells. The shot from the
<i>Brooklyn</i> that cut her water-main made it impossible
to extinguish the flames, and the fire
from the American ships grew more accurate
and deadly every minute; so she was beached
and her flag hauled down in token of surrender.</p>

<p>The men on the <i>Texas</i> raised a shout of joy.
But Captain Philip spoke from the bridge:
"Don't cheer, men; those poor fellows are
dying."</p>

<p>For less than forty minutes Admiral Cervera
had been running a race for life, and now, clad
in underclothes, he tried to escape to the shore
on a raft, directed by his son, but was captured
and taken to the <i>Gloucester</i>, where he was received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
with the honors due his rank. His
voyage from Santiago had been just six miles
and a half, but had cost the lives of nearly half
his officers and crew.</p>

<p>The <i>Vizcaya</i> had followed the <i>Teresa</i> at a
distance of about eight hundred yards in coming
out of Santiago harbor. Upon her decks,
in Havana harbor, Cuba, Spanish officers had
looked down with careless indifference upon
the sunken wreck of our gallant battleship, the
<i>Maine</i>, and it may be supposed that when she
came ploughing out of the bay, Wainwright,
late of the <i>Maine</i>, now on the little <i>Gloucester</i>,
aimed some shots at her with a special ill-will.
But the <i>Vizcaya</i>, under gathered headway,
rushed on to the west, passing the heavier
battleships <i>Iowa</i> and <i>Indiana</i>, but receiving
terrible punishment from their guns. A lieutenant
of the <i>Vizcaya</i>, taken prisoner to the
United States, in an interview by a newspaper
reporter, told of the murderous effect of the
shells from the <i>Indiana</i>.</p>

<p>"They appeared to slide along the surface
of the water and hunt for a seam in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
armor," he said. "Three of those monster
projectiles penetrated the hull of the <i>Vizcaya</i>,
and exploded there before we started for the
shore. The carnage inside the ship was something
horrible and beyond description. Fires
were started up constantly. It seemed to me
that the iron bulkheads were ablaze. Our
organization was perfect. We acted promptly
and mastered all small outbreaks of flame,
until the small ammunition magazine was exploded
by a shell. From that moment the vessel
became a furnace of fire. While we were
walking the deck, headed shoreward, we could
hear the roar of the flames under our feet
above the voice of artillery. The <i>Vizcaya's</i>
hull bellowed like a blast furnace. Why, men
sprang from the red-hot decks straight into the
mouths of sharks."</p>

<p>But the <i>Vizcaya</i> lasted longer than the
<i>Almirante Oquendo</i>, which followed her out of
the harbor. The <i>Vizcaya</i> turned at the mouth
of the harbor and went west, the <i>Brooklyn</i>,
<i>Oregon</i>, and <i>Texas</i> in hot pursuit, while the
<i>Indiana</i> and <i>Iowa</i> attacked the <i>Oquendo</i>. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
had been credited with as great speed as that of
her sister ships, but this day moved so slowly
that she fared worse than any of her comrades.
She stood the fire of her foes five minutes
longer than had the <i>Teresa</i>, then with flames
pouring out of every opening in her hull, she
ran for the beach, hauling down her flag as she
went, in token of surrender, while at the same
time men were dropping from her red-hot
decks into the water.</p>

<p>Thus, in the first three-quarters of an hour
two great Spanish war vessels were destroyed,
and the American fleet was concentrating its
fire on the other two.</p>

<p>The fighting men on the vessels were not the
only ones who did noble work for their country
that day. In the engine rooms and stoke-holes
of the men-of-war, on that scorching hot
July day, men worked naked in fiery heat.
They could hear the thunder of the guns above
them, and feel the ship tremble with the shock
of the broadsides. How the battle was going
they could not see. Deep in their fiery prison,
far below the lapping waves that rushed along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the armored hull, they only knew that if disaster
came they would suffer first and most
cruelly. A successful torpedo stroke would
mean death to them, every one. The clean
blow of an enemy's ram would in all probability
drown them like rats in a cage, even if it
did not cause them to be parboiled by the
explosion of their own boilers. A shot in the
magazine would be their death warrant. All
the perils which menaced the men who were
fighting so bravely at the guns on deck
threatened the sooty, sweating fellows who
shovelled coal and fixed fires down in the hold,
with the added certainty that for them escape
was impossible, and the inspiration which
comes from the very sight of battle was denied
them. They did their duty nobly. If we had
not the testimony of their commanders to that
effect, we still should know it, for they got out
of every ship not only the fullest speed with
which she was credited under the most favorable
circumstances, but even more&mdash;notably in
the cases of the <i>Texas</i> and <i>Oregon</i>, which, despite
bottoms fouled from long service in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
tropical waters, actually exceeded their highest
recorded speed in the chase. On the <i>Oregon</i>,
when she was silently pursuing the <i>Colon</i> at the
end of the battle, Lieutenant Milligan, who had
gone down into the furnace room to work by
the side of the men on whom so much depended,
came up to the captain to ask that a
gun might be fired now and then. "My men
were almost exhausted," said Milligan, "when
the last thirteen-inch gun was fired, and the
sound of it restored their energy, and they fell
to work with renewed vigor. If you will fire
a gun occasionally it will keep their enthusiasm
up." On most of the ships the great value of
the work the men in engine rooms were doing
was recognized by the captain's sending down
every few minutes to them an account of how
the fight progressed. Each report was received
with cheers and redoubled activity.</p>

<p>On the <i>Brooklyn</i>, when the <i>Colon</i> was making
her final race for life, Commodore Schley
sent orderlies down to the stoke-holes and
engine room with this message: "Now, boys, it
all depends on you. Everything is sunk except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the <i>Colon</i>, and she is trying to get away.
We don't want her to, and everything depends
on you." The <i>Colon</i> did not get
away.</p>

<p>The <i>Vizcaya</i> was still making a gallant running
fight, and in some degree protecting the
magnificent <i>Cristobal Colon</i>. While these
fled, disaster fell upon the two torpedo-boat
destroyers, <i>Pluton</i> and <i>Furor</i>. Instead of
dashing at the nearest American ship&mdash;which
would have been their wisest course&mdash;both
followed the example of the cruisers, and
turned along the shore to the westward.
Either of them would have been more than a
match for the little <i>Gloucester</i>, but her commander,
Richard Wainwright, sped forward in
a cloud of smoke from her own guns, receiving
unnoticed shots from the batteries and the
nearer Spanish cruisers, though one six-inch
shell would have destroyed her. The batteries
of the <i>Pluton</i> and <i>Furor</i> were of twice the
power of the <i>Gloucester's</i>, and they had, besides,
the engine of destruction which they
could send out from their torpedo tubes. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
in a few minutes Wainwright was engaged with
them both at short range and under the fire of
the Socapa battery. The other American battleships
had been firing at them, but desisted
when they perceived that the <i>Gloucester</i> alone
was capable of managing them. In a very few
minutes they both began to smoke ominously,
and their fire became much less rapid. Then
the <i>Furor</i> moved as if her steering gear had
been cut. Wainwright and his men redoubled
their efforts at the guns. Suddenly, on the
<i>Furor</i>, amidships, there shot up a great cloud
of smoke and flame, with a deafening roar and
shock that could be felt across the water, even
amid the thunders of the guns. A shell from
one of the battleships had struck her fairly,
and broken her in two, exploding either the
magazine or the boilers, or both, and she sank
like a stone.</p>

<p>Wainwright pursued the other torpedo boat,
the <i>Pluton</i>, more vigorously. She was already
badly crippled, and tried hard to escape;
but at last, fairly shot to pieces, she hauled
down her flag, and ran for the line of breaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
surf, where her men leaped overboard to escape
the fierce flames that were sweeping relentlessly
below from bow to stern.</p>

<p>The sight of their danger and distress
changed Wainwright from a pitiless foe to a
helping friend. He manned his boats and
went to the rescue of those still alive on the
burning ship. Many were saved, and the
Americans had hardly left the smoking ship
when it blew up with a resounding roar, and
vanished as had its companion. Just forty
minutes they had lasted under the American
fire, and without being at any time a serious
menace to our ships.</p>

<p>The battle had now lasted for about three-quarters
of an hour. The <i>Infanta Maria
Teresa</i> and the <i>Oquendo</i> were blazing on the
beach with their colors struck. The battleship
<i>Indiana</i> had been signalled to turn in toward
the shore and give aid to the survivors on
the burning ships. Only two Spanish vessels
were left&mdash;the <i>Vizcaya</i>, running and
fighting bravely in a hopeless struggle for life,
and the <i>Cristobal Colon</i>, which was rushing at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
great speed down the coast to the westward.
In the chase of these two vessels the <i>Brooklyn</i>
held the place of honor. Her position on the
blockade at the time that the enemy came out
was a commanding one, and her speed kept her
well to the front. At the beginning of the
fight the <i>Texas</i> was next her. In this battle
she developed marvellous speed, and fought
with reckless gallantry. The <i>Oregon</i> was
third at the start, but by a wonderful dash
passed the <i>Texas</i> and actually caught up with
the <i>Brooklyn</i>, whose tars turned out on deck
to cheer her&mdash;the wonderful fighter from
the Pacific coast dockyard. The <i>Iowa</i>
was only a short distance in their rear, and the
fire of the four was now concentrated upon the
unhappy <i>Vizcaya</i>, which had escaped serious
injury while the attention of the entire American
fleet was given to the <i>Oquendo</i> and the
<i>Teresa</i>, but now with four of the best fighting
machines in the world devoting their entire attention
to her, she began to go to pieces. The
heavy shells and smaller projectiles that struck
her made a great clangor, and caused her great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
frame to quiver. When an hour had passed
the <i>Brooklyn</i>, <i>Oregon</i>, and <i>Texas</i> were the only
ones still pursuing her. The <i>Indiana</i> had been
left behind, and the <i>Iowa</i> had stopped to aid
the burning and drowning men on the blazing
warships. The fire of the three warships was
concentrated on the <i>Vizcaya</i>. Word was passed
to the turrets and tops of the <i>Brooklyn</i> to aim
at the <i>Vizcaya</i> only. They were scarcely more
than half a mile from her, and the effect of the
shots began to tell. One of the <i>Brooklyn</i> gunners
reported to the lieutenant who had charge
of that turret that he didn't see any of the shots
dropping into the water. "Well, that's all
right," replied the officer; "if they don't drop
into the water they are hitting." And so they
were. The beautiful woodwork inside of the
vessel was all in a blaze. The hull was pierced
below the water line, the turrets were full of
dead and wounded men, and the machinery was
shattered. Captain Eulate, her commander,
was a brave officer and a gentleman, but he
found himself compelled to abandon the fight,
so turned his ship's prow toward that rocky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
shore on which lay the wrecks of the <i>Oquendo</i>,
the <i>Teresa</i>, and the <i>Furor</i>.</p>

<p>As the <i>Vizcaya</i> swung about, a shell from the
<i>Oregon</i> struck her fairly in the stern. An
enormous mass of steel, charged with explosives
of frightful power, it rushed through
the steel framework of the ship, shattering
everything in its course, crashed into the
boiler, and exploded. Words are powerless to
describe the ruin that resulted. Men, guns,
projectiles, ragged bits of steel and iron,
splinters, and indescribable <i>débris</i> were hurled
in every direction, while flames shot up
from every part of the ship. A fierce fire
raged between her decks, and those who were
gazing at her from the decks of the American
men-of-war could see what looked like a white
line reaching from her bow to the water, which
was in fact the naked men dropping one after
another over the side to seek the cool relief of
the ocean from the fiery torment they were
enduring.</p>

<p>The <i>Colon</i> was now left alone, and was doing
her utmost to escape. The men on our foremost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
pursuing ships soon perceived that there
could be no hope of escape for her. Commodore
Schley saw it, and began to lighten the
strain on his men. They were called out on
the superstructure to see what had been done
by the guns of the fleet and to watch the chase.
They came pouring out from the turrets, up
from the engine rooms and magazines&mdash;stalwart
fellows, smoke-begrimed and sweaty.
Almost abeam they saw the <i>Vizcaya</i> with men
dropping from every port. Far astern were
the smoking wrecks of the <i>Teresa</i> and <i>Oquendo</i>,
ahead on the right was the <i>Colon</i>, fleeing for
her life, while the <i>Brooklyn</i> rushed after her relentlessly.</p>

<p>As the men crowded on along the decks and
on the turret top, they suddenly and spontaneously
sent up a cheer for Admiral Schley.
The admiral, on the bridge above them, looked
down upon them with moistened eyes. "They
are the boys who did it," he said to one who
stood beside him, and he spoke truly.</p>

<p>Then the men cheered the <i>Oregon</i>, which was
coming up gallantly, and her men returned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
cheer. Now all felt that even the last of
Cervera's vessels was sure to be soon taken, and
signals of a social and jocular character were
exchanged. One from the <i>Brooklyn</i> suggested
to the <i>Oregon</i> that she try one of her thirteen-inch
guns on the chase. The great cannon
flashed and roared from the forward turret,
and the shell, which rushed past the <i>Brooklyn</i>
with a noise like a railway train, fell short.
On they rushed, the <i>Oregon</i> visibly gaining on
the fastest ship of the Spanish navy; a battleship
built for weight and solidity overhauling
a cruiser built for speed! Another shell was
sent, and fell so near the <i>Colon</i> that the captain
seemed to read in it the death-warrant of his
ship. He turned her toward the shore and
beached her, hauling down his flag as she
struck. Captain Cook went in a boat to take
possession of the prize, his crew being ordered
not to cheer or exult over the vanquished.
The <i>Colon</i> surrendered at 1.10 <span class="capsm">P.M.</span>, ending a
naval battle that lasted less than four hours,
and possessed many extraordinary and unique
qualities. It completed the wreck of Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
naval power and dealt the decisive stroke that
deprived Spain of her last remnant of American
colonies. It was of absorbing interest to
naval experts in all parts of the world, and it
was unique in that while the defeated fleet lost
six ships, more than six hundred men killed
and drowned, and eighteen hundred prisoners,
many of them wounded, the victors had but
one man killed and one wounded.</p>

<p>No wonder that when the fight was over, the
victory won&mdash;such a victory too&mdash;a Christian
man, such as Captain Philip of the <i>Texas</i>,
whose crew were cheering in a very delirium
of joy, should call them about him, and, uncovering
his head, say in a reverential tone:
"I want to make public acknowledgment here
that I believe in God the Father. I want you
all to lift your hats and from your hearts offer
silent thanks to the Almighty."</p>

<p>And truly they had abundant reason for
great thankfulness, having escaped with so
few casualties, while the foe suffered so terribly,
scores of them being literally roasted
alive, for the whole interior of the ships, <i>Vizcaya,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Oquendo</i>, and <i>Teresa</i> became like iron
furnaces at white heat. Even the decks
were red hot, and the wounded burned where
they lay. So crazed by the sight of the agony
of men wounded and held fast by the jamming
of gratings, were some of those otherwise
unhurt, that they could hardly be induced to
respond to efforts for their own rescue. They
would cling to a ladder or the side of a scorching
hot ship and have to be literally dragged
away before they would loose their hold and
drop into a boat below. Our sailors worked
hard on blistering decks, amid piles of ammunition
that were continually being exploded by
the heat, and under guns that might at any
minute send out a withering blast, risking life
and limbs in succoring their defeated foes; for
it is not too much to say that in that work of
mercy the bluejackets encountered dangers
quite as deadly as those they had met in the
fury of battle.</p>

<p>The poor marksmanship of the Spaniards
saved our ships from being much damaged. A
good many shots struck: the <i>Brooklyn</i> bore in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
all some forty scars of the fight, twenty-five of
them having been shells; but she was so slightly
injured that she could have begun all over
again when the <i>Colon</i> turned over on the shore.
The <i>Iowa</i> was hit twice, the <i>Texas</i> three times,
one shell smashing her chart-house and another
making a hole in her smokestack. The
injuries to the other ships were of even less
importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">That</span> morning that Cervera attempted his
flight from Santiago, General Shafter sent into
the Spanish lines by a flag of truce a demand
for the surrender of the city. "I have the
honor to inform you," he said, "that unless
you surrender I shall be compelled to shell
Santiago de Cuba. Please instruct the citizens
of all foreign countries, and all women
and children, that they should leave the city
before 10 <span class="capsm">A.M.</span> to-morrow."</p>

<p>That flag of truce had been gone only two or
three hours when there came a sudden rumor
that the Spanish fleet had gone to destruction,
depriving Santiago of her chief defence. Our
soldiers were so sure of the prowess of our
sailors that they hailed the rumor as fact,&mdash;as
news of a victory,&mdash;and when later in the evening
the actual intelligence of Schley's glorious
triumph reached them they went wild with joy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
danced on the crest of the defences, in full
view of the Spaniards, venturing to do so because&mdash;as
there was a truce&mdash;no jealous
sharpshooter would dare fire on them. And
the band played patriotic and popular airs, particularly
"There'll be a Hot Time in the Old
Town To-night." Bonfires were made and salutes
fired.</p>

<p>Drs. Harold and Herbert Travilla, wearied
with their labors for the sick and wounded, rejoiced
as heartily as any one else over the good
news, yet at the same time felt pity for the
suffering of those of the foe who had perished
so miserably by shot, shell, and fire. They
would have been glad to aid the wounded prisoners,
but their hands were already full, in giving
needed attention to our own men so sorely
injured by Spanish shot and shell. So incessant
and arduous had been their labors in that
line, and so fierce and exhausting was the heat,
that they were themselves well-nigh worn out.
There had been hope that the city would surrender,
but on the night of the 3d&mdash;the day
of the naval battle&mdash;four thousand fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Spanish troops entered it, and the hoped-for
surrender was not made.</p>

<p>The Americans in the trenches were hot,
hungry, and water-soaked, and some of them
grew very impatient. Said one of the Rough
Riders: "Now that we've got those Dagoes
corralled, why don't we brand them?"</p>

<p>On the 6th something happened that broke
the monotony and gave great joy to the soldiers
in the trenches. A cavalcade of men was
seen coming from the beleaguered city, the first
of whom was quickly recognized as Lieutenant
Hobson, who with his seven comrades had
gone out one night, weeks before, on a vessel,
the <i>Merrimac</i>, to sink her across the narrow
entrance to the channel leading into Santiago
harbor, and so bottle up the Spanish fleet.</p>

<p>They failed, and were taken prisoners by the
Spaniards, and had been spending weeks shut
up in Morro castle, but now were exchanged for
seven prisoners taken at San Juan. At sight
of them the American soldiers seemed to go
mad with joy. They yelled, danced, laughed,
and even wept for joy. Then the band on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
foremost line struck up "The Star Spangled
Banner," and all stood silent at a salute. But
the moment the music ceased it seemed as if
Bedlam had broken loose. The regulars
crowded about the heroes, cheering them,
shaking them by the hand, while they from
their ambulance yelled compliments and congratulations
to the tattered and dirty soldiers.</p>

<p>And when those returned sailors reached the
fleet after dark, they found the ships' companies
turned out as if to greet an admiral at
least, coming to visit them, and as their launch
was seen approaching from the shore the
cheers of their brother tars made the hills of
Cuba ring almost as had the thundering fire
of Morro and Estrella when levelled against
them nearly six weeks before.</p>

<p>The surrender of Santiago took place on the
18th of July. By that time there was a great
deal of sickness among our troops, and our
friends Harold and Herbert Travilla were kept
very busy attending to the sick and wounded.
So overworked were they, and so injuriously
affected by the malarious climate, that both became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
ill; Herbert so much so that he could
scarcely keep about, and his brother began to
question whether it were not his duty to take or
send him home, or farther north, to join their
mother and a number of the relatives and connections
who were spending the summer on
the Hudson, or at some Northern seaside resort,
which he was at liberty to do, as they were
serving as volunteer surgeons, and without pay.</p>

<p>On the morning after the surrender Herbert
found himself entirely unfit for duty, and on
his account Harold felt much depressed as he
went through the hospital examining and prescribing
for his patients. Presently he heard
a quick, manly step, then a familiar voice saying
in cheery tones:</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Harold! How are you?"</p>

<p>The young doctor turned quickly with the
joyous exclamation:</p>

<p>"Why, Brother Levis! can it be possible that
this is you?" holding out his hand in cordial
greeting as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Not only possible, but an undeniable fact,"
returned Captain Raymond, with his pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
smile, and giving the offered hand a warm,
brotherly pressure.</p>

<p>"And you came in your yacht? Have some
of the family come with you&mdash;my mother&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" returned the captain quickly;
"at present it is much too warm for her&mdash;or
any of our lady friends&mdash;in this locality. She
and my family are at Crag Cottage, and by her
request I have come to take you and Herbert
aboard the <i>Dolphin</i> and carry you to her. And
I didn't come alone; your brothers Edward and
Walter are with me, and your cousin Chester
also."</p>

<p>"Oh, what delightful news!" exclaimed
Harold, his eyes shining with joy. "And your
yacht is here?"</p>

<p>"Lying down yonder in the harbor, just
waiting for two additions to her list of passengers.
But where is Herbert?" looking about
as if in search of him.</p>

<p>"Lying in our tent; on the sick list, poor
dear fellow!" sighed Harold. "Can you wait
five minutes for me to get through here for
the present? Then I will take you to him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly; longer than that, if necessary.
Ah, I see it was time&mdash;high time for me to
come for you boys."</p>

<p>Harold smiled in a rather melancholy way
at that.</p>

<p>"I have grown to feel quite old since we
have been here in the midst of so much suffering,
and obliged to take so heavy a load of care
and responsibility&mdash;performing serious operations
and the like," he said with a sigh. "I
must find you a seat," he added, glancing about
in search of one.</p>

<p>"No, no," the captain hastened to say; "I
should prefer walking around here and making
acquaintance with some of these poor brave
fellows&mdash;if you think it would not be unpleasant
to them."</p>

<p>"I think they would be pleased to have you
do so," was Harold's reply.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he and the captain went
into the tent where Herbert lay in a burning
fever. The very sight of the captain and the
news that he had come to carry him and
Harold north to cooler climate, mother, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
other dear ones seemed so greatly to revive
him that he insisted upon being considered
quite able to be taken immediately on board
the yacht, and his brother and brother-in-law
promptly set about preparations to carry out
his wish.</p>

<p>"You will go too, Harold?" he said inquiringly
to his brother.</p>

<p>"To the <i>Dolphin</i>? Yes, certainly, old fellow;
you are my patient now, and I must see to
it that you are well accommodated and cared
for," returned Harold in a sprightly tone.</p>

<p>"And you are going with me to see to that
throughout the voyage?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Harold returned in a tone
of hesitation; "these poor, wounded, and sick
fellows&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll be down on your back as sick as any
of them if you stay here another week,"
growled Herbert. "And with nobody to take
care of you you'll die, and that'll break
mother's heart. And as you are working without
pay, you've a right to go as soon as you
will."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said the captain, "and if you fall
sick you'll be no service, but only in the way.
Better let me attend to the necessary arrangements
for you, and carry you off along with
your brother."</p>

<p>After a little hesitation Harold consented
to that, saying that after seeing Herbert on
board the yacht he would return, make all
necessary arrangements, bid good-bye to his
patients, then board the <i>Dolphin</i> for the homeward
voyage.</p>

<p>"That's right, brother mine," Herbert said,
with a pleased smile; "I'd be very unwilling to
go, leaving you here alone; and what would
mother say?"</p>

<p>It took but a few minutes to pick up their
few belongings, and they were soon on the deck
of the yacht receiving the warm greetings of
their brothers and cousins, who, however,
seemed greatly concerned over their weary and
haggard looks.</p>

<p>"You are worn out, lads," said Edward,
"and the best and kindest thing we can do will
be to carry you up north to a cooler climate;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
and to mother and the others, who will, I hope,
be able soon to nurse you back to health and
strength."</p>

<p>"So say I," said Chester.</p>

<p>"And I," added Walter. "I have always
found mother's nursing the best to be had anywhere
or from anybody."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the captain, "and there are sisters
and others to help with it at Crag Cottage,
where I hope to land you a few days
hence."</p>

<p>In a brief time Herbert was comfortably
established in one of the neat staterooms, and
left in Edward's charge, while Harold went
ashore to make his farewell visit to his hospital
patients, while Chester and Walter accompanied
the captain in paying a visit to some
of the men-of-war officered by old acquaintances
and chums of the last-named when he
belonged to the navy.</p>

<p>It was most interesting to them all to see
both the men and the vessels that had taken
part in that remarkable battle, and to hear
accounts of its scenes from the actors in them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
In fact, so much interested were they that
Captain Raymond said he could not have Edward
and Harold miss it; they must visit the
vessels later, leaving Chester and Walter in
charge of Herbert, since he was too ill to accompany
them.</p>

<p>That afternoon the plan was carried out,
and that night the <i>Dolphin</i> started on her return
voyage to the north. The change from
the rough camps on Cuban soil to the luxurious
cabin of the <i>Dolphin</i> was very agreeable and
refreshing to the young volunteer physicians,
but they were too thoroughly worn out with
their toils, anxieties, and privations for even
so great and beneficial a change to work an immediate
cure. They were still on the sick list
when they reached Crag Cottage.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Crag Cottage</span> had been at Evelyn's desire
so added to in the past years that it could now
accommodate a large number of guests. There
were so many who were near and dear to her,
and whom she loved to gather about her, that
she could not be content till this was done.
Now the families of Fairview, Ion, and Woodburn
were all spending the summer there; also
Ronald Lilburn and Annis, his wife&mdash;though
just now several of the gentlemen had gone to
Cuba to learn of the welfare of Harold and
Herbert Travilla, about whom their mother
had grown very solicitous. They had been
gone long enough for hopes to be entertained
of their speedy return, but there was no certainty
in regard to the time of their arrival at
the cottage.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon. The elder
people were gathered on the front porch overlooking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the river, most of the younger ones
amusing themselves about the grounds.
Grandma Elsie was gazing out upon the river,
with a slightly anxious expression of countenance.</p>

<p>"Looking for the <i>Dolphin</i>, mamma?" asked
her daughter Violet.</p>

<p>"Yes; though it is hardly time to expect her
yet, I fear."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, mamma, for there she is now!"
exclaimed Violet, springing to her feet in her
delight, and pointing to a vessel passing up
the river, which had just come into sight.</p>

<p>Many of those on the porch and the young
folks in the grounds had also caught sight of
her, and a joyous shout was raised: "The
<i>Dolphin!</i> the <i>Dolphin!</i> there she is! the folks
have come!"</p>

<p>"Oh, can we run down and get aboard of
her, mamma?" asked Elsie Raymond. "I'm
in such a hurry to see papa and get a kiss from
him."</p>

<p>"You won't have long to wait for that, I am
sure," returned her mother, with a smile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
"But it will be better to wait a few minutes
and get it here. There are so many of us that
if we should all go down to the landing we
would be very much in the way."</p>

<p>Others thought the same, and the ladies and
children waited where they were while Mr.
Leland and Edward, his eldest son, went down
the winding path that led to the little landing-place
at the foot of the hill, to greet the friends
on board the yacht and give any assistance that
might be needed.</p>

<p>They found all well but the two doctors,
Harold able to walk up to the house with the
help of a sustaining arm, Herbert having to
be borne on a litter. The mother's heart
ached at sight of his wan cheeks and sunken
eyes, but he told her the joy of her presence
and loving care would soon work a change for
the better. He was speedily carried to a comfortable
bed, and everything done to cheer,
strengthen, and relieve him.</p>

<p>Nor was Harold's reception any less tenderly
affectionate and sympathizing. His mother was
very glad that he was not so ill as his brother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and hoped the pure air and cooler climate
would soon restore him to his wonted health
and strength.</p>

<p>"I hope so, mother dear," he said, forcing a
playful tone and a smile, "and that they will
soon do as much for Herbert also. He, poor
fellow, is not fit to be up at all, and I think it
will be well for me to retire early."</p>

<p>"You must do just what you deem best for
your health, my dear boy," said his mother.
"But shall I not send for a physician, as I
fear neither of you is well enough to manage
the case of the other?"</p>

<p>"No, no, mother, please don't!" exclaimed
Herbert; "Harold is well enough to prescribe
for me, and I prefer him to any other doctor."</p>

<p>"As I should, if he were quite well," she
said, regarding Harold with a proud, fond
smile, which he returned, saying in cheerful
tones, "My trouble is more weariness than illness,
mother, and I hope a few days of rest
here in the pleasant society of relatives and
friends will quite restore me to wonted health
and vigor."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope so, indeed," she said, "and that
Herbert may not be far behind you in recovering
his."</p>

<p>In the meantime joyful greetings were being
exchanged among the relatives and friends
upon the porch, and the returned travellers
were telling of what they had seen and heard
in their absence, especially on the coast of
Cuba. It was all very interesting to the auditors,
but the tale was not half told when the
tea-bell summoned them to their evening
meal.</p>

<p>Chester had a good deal more to tell Lucilla
as they wandered about the grounds together
after leaving the table. And she was greatly
interested.</p>

<p>"I should like to get aboard a battleship,"
she said; "particularly the <i>Oregon</i>. What a
grand vessel it must be!"</p>

<p>"It is," said Chester, "and did grand work
in that battle; a battle which will go down in
history as a most remarkable one. I am proud
of the brave tars who fought it, and not less
so of the fine fellows who kept up the fires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
under the engines, which were as necessary to
the gaining of the victory as was the firing of
the guns."</p>

<p>"But, oh, the terrible carnage!" exclaimed
Lucilla, with a shudder.</p>

<p>"Yes, that was awful; and what a wonder&mdash;what
a cause for gratitude to God&mdash;that but
one was killed and so few badly wounded on
our ships."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed! and truly I believe that was
because we were fighting for the deliverance of
the downtrodden and oppressed. Don't you,
Chester?"</p>

<p>"Most assuredly I do," was his emphatic rejoinder.
"Has there been any news from
Manila?" he asked presently.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "but we are looking every
day for a letter from Max. Oh, I do hope he
is still unharmed! That victory of Dewey's
seems to me to have been as great and wonderful
as this later one at Santiago."</p>

<p>"So I think. Ah, Lu, darling, I wish Max
might be ordered home soon, both for his own
sake and ours."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; but try to be patient," she returned,
in a light and cheery tone. "I am sure we
are having pleasant times as things are, and we
are young enough to wait, as my father says.
I am still almost three years younger than he
thinks a girl ought to be to undertake the cares
of married life."</p>

<p>"I don't mean you shall have much care, and
I am sure you are fully capable of all you would
be called upon to do. My darling, if you don't
have an easy life it shall be from no fault of
mine."</p>

<p>"I am sure of that, Chester, and not in the
least afraid to trust my happiness to your
keeping. But I am willing to wait somewhat
longer to please father and to have Max
present&mdash;especially as Eva's bridegroom. Oh,
I think a double wedding will be just lovely!"</p>

<p>"If one didn't have to wait for it," sighed
Chester. "Yet it is a great consolation that
we can be together pretty nearly every day in
the year."</p>

<p>"Yes, you are a very attentive lover, and I
appreciate it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Later in the evening, when most of the
guests had retired to their apartments for the
night, the captain and his eldest daughter had
a bit of private chat upon the porch, for she
still retained her love for that, and it was
hardly less enjoyable to him.</p>

<p>"You don't know how I missed this bit of
private talk with you, father, while you were
away on your little trip," she said, with a loving
look up into his eyes as she stood by his
side with his arm about her waist.</p>

<p>"Probably not more than I did, daughter
mine," he returned, stroking her hair
caressingly, then pressing his lips to her
forehead and cheek. "Pacing the deck alone
I missed my little girl more than I can tell
her."</p>

<p>"Ah, didn't you almost wish you had
granted my request to be allowed to go along
with you?" she asked, with a pleased little
laugh.</p>

<p>"No, my child; you are too great a treasure
for me willingly to expose you to the risks of
such a voyage at such a time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>"You dear father! you are so kindly careful
of me, and of all your children."</p>

<p>"It behooves a man to be careful of his
treasures," he said. "I should have greatly
enjoyed your companionship, daughter, if I
could have had it without risk to you."</p>

<p>"I should have liked to see the warships and
the scene of the battle," she said. "What a
terrible battle it was, father&mdash;for the Spaniards,
at least."</p>

<p>"Yes," he sighed. "May the time soon
come when men shall learn war no more, but
shall beat their swords into ploughshares and
their spears into pruning hooks."</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem as though that time can be
very near," she said. "Papa, do you think
Max is in much danger there in Manila?"</p>

<p>"I hardly know, daughter; I hope we shall
hear from him soon. I hardly think there will
be much, if any more, fighting for him to do
there at present. But his next letter will
probably enable us to judge better about that."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope it will come soon!" she exclaimed
in a tone of ardent desire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"As I do," he sighed. "I cannot but feel
anxious about my dear boy; though the worst
seems to be over, there."</p>

<p>The next morning's mail brought the desired
letters to father, sisters, and ladylove. The
captain's gave news of the doings of the army
and navy, and after a private perusal he read
the greater part of it aloud to the family and
friends. It told of the irksomeness of their
situation, the weariness of the watching and
waiting for troops that did not come, the admiral's
patience and forbearance in taking the
delay so quietly, the troubles with the insurgents
under Aguinaldo, and the commanders of
the warships of several European nations.
"We know," he said, "that those fellows are
looking out for the first sign of weakness on
our part, or the first disaster that might befall
us, intending to take advantage of it to intervene.
I can tell you, father, that Admiral
Dewey is a credit to his country and that
country's navy. He is very kind-hearted, and
takes excellent care of his men; he is gentle,
kind to all, but thorough, determined, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
energetic; everything under his control must
be as perfect as possible. When it comes to
the necessity for fighting he believes in being
most thoroughly prepared, and striking quick,
hard blows, soon putting the enemy in a condition
where it cannot fight. He says little or
nothing about what he expects, but seems to be
always ready for whatever happens. The behavior
of the foreign ships must be a constant
worry to him, though he says little or nothing
about it. The Germans here seem to study
methods of annoying us. Their ships are constantly
coming in or going out of Manila Bay
at all hours, and on the most frivolous pretexts&mdash;sometimes
at night, in a way that makes our
lookouts think them Spanish torpedo boats;
and should we send a shot at one of them it
might cause the gravest international complications.
And the German navy officers make
the Spanish officers their chosen companions.</p>

<p>"The other day our admiral learned that one
of the German vessels had violated neutrality
by landing provisions in Manila. He summoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the flag lieutenant to his cabin and
when the officer came&mdash;'Oh, Brumby,' he said,
'I wish you to take the barge and go over to
the German flagship. Give Admiral von
Diederich my compliments, and say that I wish
to call his attention to the fact that the vessels
of his squadron have shown an extraordinary
disregard of the usual courtesies of naval intercourse,
and that finally one of them has committed
a gross breach of neutrality in landing
provisions in Manila, a port which I am blockading.'
The admiral spoke in a quiet, gently
modulated voice, but as the lieutenant turned
to go he called him back and added in a wrathful
tone, 'And, Brumby, tell Admiral von
Diederich that if he wants a fight, he can have
it right now.'</p>

<p>"The message had the desired effect, and we
have had much less annoyance from the Germans
since.</p>

<p>"The English squadron here is equal to the
German, and I am glad to be able to say that
the British officers lose no opportunity to show
their friendship for us. I am told that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
German admiral asked Captain Chichester, the
British commander, what the English would do
in case the Germans should protest against an
American bombardment of Manila, and that
the messenger received the answer: 'Say to
Admiral von Diederich that he will have to call
on Admiral Dewey to find out what the British
ships will do in such an event. Admiral
Dewey is the only man authorized to answer
that question.' I cannot vouch for the exact
truthfulness of this report," Max went on,
"but I can for the hostility of the Germans
and the friendliness of the English. And we
hear reliable reports of sailors' fights in Hong-Kong,
in which British and Yankee bluejackets
fight shoulder to shoulder against German
seamen subjects of the Kaiser."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is good!" exclaimed Lucilla, as
her father paused in his reading, "and I hope
we and the British will always be friends after
this. Don't you think, father, that joining
together we could rule the world?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and I hope, with you, that we may
always be friends; though it is not necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
that we should always take part in each
other's quarrels."</p>

<p>"I hope Max is well?" said Violet inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes," said his father, "he tells me he is,
and that he came through the battle without
the slightest wound."</p>

<p>"I hope the President will let Dewey come
home soon, and Brother Max with him," said
little Elsie. "Doesn't he say anything about
it, papa?"</p>

<p>"No, my child, except that he fears it will
be months, if not years, before we see each
other again. But we won't despair; it may be
that the war will be short, and peace return
our dear boy to us sooner than now seems
likely."</p>

<p>The captain seemed to have finished reading
the part of Max's letter which he thought best
for all to hear, and was folding it up.
"Mother," he said, turning to Mrs. Travilla,
"the air out here is delightful this morning;
don't you think it might do Harold good
to lie yonder in the hammock? and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
he could come out with the assistance of
my arm?"</p>

<p>"I certainly do," she said, "and thank you
for your kind offer. Both he and Herbert
will be deeply interested in the contents of
Max's letter&mdash;if you are willing to let them see
or hear it."</p>

<p>"Certainly, mother," the captain hastened
to say. "I will carry it in and read it to them
before we bring Harold out."</p>

<p>And so he did. They were both greatly
interested, and upon the conclusion of the
reading Harold was glad to accept the offer of
the captain to help him out to the porch and
into a hammock, where he could lie at ease
and enjoy the companionship of other members
of the party, older and younger. They were
all ready to wait upon him and to do whatever
they could for his comfort and entertainment.
None more so than Grace, whose ministrations
he seemed to prefer to any other. As the days
went on they were often left alone together,
while husbands and wives and lovers devoted
themselves to each other; Mrs. Travilla herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
to her sicker son, and Evelyn to her housekeeping
and correspondence, especially the
letters to Max, her affianced.</p>

<p>Grace was fond of Harold, as she thought
any one might be of so kind an uncle, whose
medical skill had many times relieved suffering
for her, and who had always shown kindly sympathy
in her ailments. She wanted to make a
suitable return for it all, so endeavored to
amuse him with cheerful chat, music, and reading
aloud anything that he seemed to care to
hear.</p>

<p>He fell more deeply in love with her day by
day, and often found it difficult to refrain from
telling the tale to her, and pleading for a return.
His mother saw it all, and at length advised
him to speak to Grace's father, tell him
the whole story, and crave permission to do and
say what he could to win her heart.</p>

<p>"I have thought it might be best to wait
some years, mother," he said. "I fear he will
be astonished, indignant, and deprive me of
her sweet society."</p>

<p>"Astonished he probably will be," she said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
"but surely not indignant; and when he has
fully considered the matter, remembering that
there is no tie of blood between you, I think he
will not withhold his consent, provided you are
willing to defer marriage till she is of suitable
age."</p>

<p>"I hope you are right, mother, but such a
mixture of relationships as it would make&mdash;I
fear he will think that an insurmountable
difficulty."</p>

<p>"But to rob his dearly loved daughter of a
life of wedded happiness he will think still
worse, if I am not greatly mistaken in him.
And as for the mixture of relationships, you
can still be brother to him and your sister
Violet, and Grace remain his daughter."</p>

<p>"You are the best of comforters and advisers,
mother," he said, "and I will take your
advice, and make a clean breast of it to the
captain at the earliest opportunity."</p>

<p>He did so before the day was over. Seeing
the captain in the grounds, he joined him with
a request for a bit of private chat.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said the captain, leading the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
way to the summerhouse on the edge of the
cliff. "If you want assistance in any way that
I can give it, I need hardly tell you that it will
be a pleasure to me to do so; especially as you
are the brother of my dear wife."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Brother Levis, I do not doubt
that in the least; and yet&mdash;&mdash;" He stammered
and paused, coloring deeply.</p>

<p>"I think you need not hesitate to tell me,"
the captain said, with a look of surprise. "I
feel very sure you would not ask anything
wrong or unreasonable."</p>

<p>"No; my request is neither, I think. It is
that I may, if I can, win the heart and hand of
your daughter Grace."</p>

<p>"Surely, surely you must acknowledge that
that is unreasonable!" exclaimed the captain,
in a tone of astonishment not unmixed with
indignation. "Such a mixture of relationships&mdash;making
you your sister's son-in-law, and
my daughter my sister-in-law!"</p>

<p>"My mother's idea is that we might keep
to our own relationships as they are now; and
she thinks as there is absolutely no tie of blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
between us there could be nothing wrong in
such a marriage."</p>

<p>"No, perhaps not absolutely wrong, but very
distasteful to me. Besides, as you yourself
must acknowledge, Grace is entirely too young
to marry."</p>

<p>"But all the time growing older, as well as
more and more beautiful, and I can wait.
She is worth waiting for as long as Jacob
served for Rachel. And would it not be wise
to give her to a physician, who will make her
health his constant care?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," returned the captain, with a
rather perplexed and sad sort of smile; "and
if you have won her heart and are willing to
wait till she is of suitable age, I&mdash;don't forbid
you to tell her&mdash;how dearly you love her&mdash;if
you can."</p>

<p>"A thousand thanks, Brother Levis!" exclaimed
Harold, seizing the captain's hand
in a vise-like grasp, and giving it a hearty
shake.</p>

<p>"I don't know how to put my love into
words&mdash;it seems to me they would be powerless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
to express it&mdash;but I shall try and hope to
win a return by untiring devotion."</p>

<p>"She has a loving heart, and her father finds
it hard to be called upon to resign the first
place in it," the captain said, with an involuntary
sigh.</p>

<p>"But let us hope that it will be for her happiness,
captain; and I think we both love her
well enough to resign a good deal for that."</p>

<p>"Her father certainly does," said the
captain. "Dear child! she has been a great
comfort and blessing to me since my eyes first
rested upon her dear little face. She has
never caused me a pang, except by her ill-health
and feebleness."</p>

<p>"I have known her long enough and well
enough to be sure of that," said Harold. "She
certainly has a lovely disposition, as well as a
beautiful face and form. I feel that to win
her for my own will be the greatest good fortune
that could possibly come to me."</p>

<p>"I am glad you appreciate the worth of my
dear child," the captain said, with emotion,
"and if you have won her heart I am not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
afraid to trust her happiness to your keeping.
But, understand, I cannot let you take her at
once."</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand, and shall not take any
unfair advantage of your reluctantly granted
permission, Brother Levis; but if I can win her
consent, her heart, I shall be a very happy
man, and wait contentedly&mdash;or at least ungrumblingly&mdash;until
you grant us leave to become
husband and wife."</p>

<p>Harold was not long in availing himself
of the consent given. He was on the watch
for an opportunity to tell his tale of love
to the one most deeply concerned. He
coaxed her out to that very spot where he and
her father had had their private talk, there
told her what she was to him, and asked if she
could return his affection and willingly give
herself to him. She was evidently much surprised,
listened with an agitated air and face
suffused with blushes, then said low and hesitatingly:</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Harold! how can you? You are
so good and wise&mdash;so much older than I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
am&mdash;and&mdash;and father has often told me that I am
only a little girl&mdash;not nearly old enough to
think about&mdash;about such things&mdash;and so I am
sure he wouldn't want you to talk to me as you
did just now."</p>

<p>"But I spoke to him first, and gained his
permission to tell you of my love. He probably
will not let us marry for some years to
come, even if you care for me in that way;
but he is willing that we should become engaged
if we choose, and be lovers till he thinks
you are old enough to marry. And oh, darling!
if you care for me, and will promise to be
mine at some future day, it will make me the
happiest of men. Oh, dearest! can't you love
me in that way, even just a little?" he concluded
imploringly, taking her hand in his and
holding it in a tenderly affectionate pressure.</p>

<p>"I can't help loving you, Uncle Harold, you
are so, <i>so very</i> good and kind to me. But I
never thought of&mdash;of your being my lover; for
I'm not wise and good enough for you."</p>

<p>"I should put it just the other way, that I
am not half wise and good enough for you, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
darling, my fairy queen," he said, venturing to
put an arm about her, draw her into a close
embrace, and press an ardent kiss upon her
lips.</p>

<p>She made no resistance, and a few more
words of love and whispered tenderness
caused the sweet, blushing face to grow radiant
with happiness. She did not deny that she
returned his affection, but at length owned in a
few low-breathed, hesitating words that she did.</p>

<p>Her face was beaming when they returned to
the house, and when she came to her father
for the usual good-night caress, he folded her
close to his heart and gazing searchingly into
the sweet, blushing face, said tenderly:</p>

<p>"My darling little daughter looks very
happy to-night. Won't you let your father
into the secret of it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, papa; I never meant to keep
anything from you," she murmured, half under
her breath, and hiding her blushing face on his
breast. "I always mean to tell you every
thing worth while, because we love each other
so very, very dearly. I am happy because of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
what Uncle Harold has been telling me; and
he says he told you first, so you know. And
you are willing, papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes, daughter, when the right time comes,
since it seems it will make you happy. But,"
he sighed, "it is a little hard for your father
to find other men getting the love of his dear
daughters away from him."</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, dear, dearest papa, don't think
that!" she said, with tears in her voice. "I've
always loved you dearly, and it seems to me
that I love you better just now than I ever did
before."</p>

<p>"Ah, is that so, daughter mine?" he said,
giving her another tender caress; "it makes me
happy to hear it, and to believe that my dear
Grace will never cease to love me, and will always
feel sure of her father's loving sympathy
in all her joys and sorrows."</p>

<p>"It is very sweet to know that, papa dear,"
she said. "Oh, I am just the happiest girl,
with so many and such dear loved ones. But
even with all the others, father, I couldn't do
without your love."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope not, dear child. It would be hard
indeed for me to doubt that, or to be deprived
of yours. But now bid me good-night and go
to your rest, for late hours have always been
bad for you."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I know; and my dear, kind father
is always so tenderly careful of me," she said,
giving and receiving a close, loving embrace.</p>

<p>It had been a sultry day, followed by a delightful
evening, a cool, refreshing breeze
coming from the river, and a full moon in a
clear sky making it almost as light as day in
the grounds, about which the elder members of
the party were scattered. The captain left the
porch where he and his daughter Grace had
had their little chat, and joined a group under
the trees on the lawn. It consisted of Mrs.
Travilla&mdash;or Grandma Elsie, as his first set of
children had been accustomed to call her&mdash;her
daughters, Mrs. Leland and Mrs. Raymond,
and her sons Harold, Herbert, and Walter.
There was a slight flutter of excitement
among them as he joined them and took possession
of a vacant seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am glad you have come, captain," said
Mrs. Travilla. "Harold has just been telling
us of your great kindness to him, and I want
to thank you for it."</p>

<p>"Ah! what was that?" he asked in a tone
that seemed to express surprise. "There are
few things I would not do for you or yours,
mother."</p>

<p>"I believe that, and you have given him the
right to win, if he can, a precious treasure; and
to give to me the dearest of little daughters."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes!" he said, as if just comprehending
her meaning, "and to her father she is such a
treasure as any man might covet and be rejoiced
to win."</p>

<p>"An opinion in which I am sure we will all
agree," said Violet. "I, who certainly know
her well, think she is an inestimable treasure."</p>

<p>"An opinion in which we can all join you,
I am sure," added Herbert, "and I think my
brother a most fortunate man."</p>

<p>"That is exactly what he thinks of himself,"
said Harold, with a happy laugh.
"Though there has to be a long, long waiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
spell before the full extent of that happiness
can be realized."</p>

<p>"How our young folks are pairing off!" remarked
Mrs. Leland, with a slight sigh.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," said Violet, "but fortunately
they don't pair off with strangers and leave us.
That makes it much easier to bear, doesn't it,
my dear?"</p>

<p>"Yes; except for the mixture of relationships,"
returned the captain a trifle ruefully.</p>

<p>"Is the thing to be kept a secret?" queried
Mrs. Leland.</p>

<p>"I am entirely willing it should be known in
the connection," said Captain Raymond.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was growing late, and Evelyn's guests,
accustomed to keeping early hours while at
Crag Cottage, had nearly all retired to their
rooms for the night. But Chester Dinsmore
and Lucilla Raymond were just returning from
a stroll down the river bank, and as they neared
the house they could see the captain pacing
the front porch.</p>

<p>"There is papa now," said Lucilla. "I am
afraid he will think I have been out rather
late."</p>

<p>"Are you afraid of a scolding?" asked
Chester.</p>

<p>"No; I may get a gentle reproof, but nothing
worse. Papa never really scolds; but I
can't bear to have him displeased with me.
My dear, dear father! I believe I give him all
the love that would have been divided between
him and my mother had she lived."</p>

<p>"I am not surprised at that," returned Chester,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
"for he is certainly worthy of it. I have
learned to love and honor him myself as if I
were his own son."</p>

<p>"Oh, Chester, how glad I am to hear you
say that!" exclaimed Lucilla.</p>

<p>But that ended the talk, for they were at the
foot of the porch steps, and the captain spoke,
addressing them. "Ah, so here you are at
last, my dears. I was beginning to feel a trifle
anxious lest something had befallen you."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, father! we are all right," exclaimed
Lucilla, in lively tones, "but the bewitching
moonlight and pleasant breeze tempted us to
linger longer than usual. I hope you are not
vexed with us?"</p>

<p>"Not very seriously, daughter," he said,
with a smile, "but it is high time now that you
were getting ready for your night's rest. I
want you to have plenty of that, and I know
you like to be up early."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, father; for my early walks and
talks with you are among my greatest
pleasures."</p>

<p>"Your father in the morning, your lover at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
night," Chester said, with a pleasant laugh.
"I'm glad and thankful, captain, that you let
me have her for something like half the time.
Good-night, now! and pleasant dreams to you
both," he added, turning away and passing
into the house, hardly waiting for their return
of his parting good wishes.</p>

<p>"Now I suppose I must say good-night and
go too," Lucilla said, putting her arms about
her father's neck and looking up lovingly into
his face.</p>

<p>"I shall take about five minutes of your
society first," he returned, smiling and patting
her cheek. "I have something to tell you;
something that will, perhaps, be a little surprise
to you."</p>

<p>"Nothing bad, I hope, father?"</p>

<p>"No, not exactly bad&mdash;though I must own it
is something of a trial to me. Your sister
Grace has followed your bad example, and
given the first place in her heart to another;
my consent has been asked, given, and they
are engaged, though not to marry for the next
five years."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>"Father!" exclaimed Lucilla, in a tone of
utter astonishment, "to whom? Chester's
brother Frank?"</p>

<p>"What a guess!" laughed her father.
"No; try again."</p>

<p>She reflected a moment, then&mdash;"It can't be
Uncle Harold?" she ventured, in a tone that
seemed to say that that was hardly possible.
"He is surely much too old for her."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately I cannot make that objection,
since there is some years' less difference
in their ages than in your Mamma Vi's and
mine."</p>

<p>"Oh, papa! and are they really lovers, and
engaged?"</p>

<p>"Yes; though such a match is very distasteful
to me&mdash;simply on account of the mixed-up
relationship that their marriage would bring
about; but when I found the fancy and affection
were mutual, I could not withhold my
consent."</p>

<p>"You dear father! you are always so kindly
considerate of other people's welfare and happiness,"
she said in tones tremulous with emotion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
"I am sure nobody ever had a kinder,
better father than ours."</p>

<p>"It is most pleasant to have my daughter
think so, whether I deserve it or not," he said
low and tenderly, holding her close to his heart
and pressing kisses on her forehead, cheek,
and lips. "Now go and make yourself ready
for bed," he added, "and don't let this bit of
surprising news keep you from sleeping. I
want my dear eldest daughter fresh and bright
for my entertainment in the morning."</p>

<p>The house being so full, Lucilla, Grace, and
Evelyn shared the same room. Grace was in
bed, but not asleep as usual, Eva preparing for
rest, when Lucilla came in from her talk with
her father. She glanced at her sister, and
seeing her eyes closed thought her sleeping.</p>

<p>"Oh, Eva!" she whispered to her friend,
"do you know&mdash;have you heard the news?"</p>

<p>"News? No. I have been busy about
household matters, and no one has told anything.
What is it&mdash;war news?"</p>

<p>"No, oh, no!" glancing smilingly toward
Grace; "something even more interesting, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
think, unless Max were concerned in it. It is
that we have another pair of lovers in the
house&mdash;Gracie there and Uncle Harold. I'll
have to quit calling him 'uncle,' though, since
he is to be my brother one of these days."</p>

<p>"Is it possible! Well, he has won a prize,
I think."</p>

<p>Grace was not asleep now; her wide open
eyes were fixed upon the two girls and her
cheeks rosy with blushes. "No, it's I that
have, Eva," she said. "I don't know how anybody
so good and wise and kind could take a
fancy to poor silly little me!"</p>

<p>At that Lucilla ran to the bed, threw her
arms about her sister, and showered kisses
upon her lips and cheeks. "You dear, dear
thing! you are neither poor nor silly," she said.
"I think the only wonder is that all the men
don't fall head over ears in love with you.
They certainly would if they had good sense,
taste, and discernment."</p>

<p>At that Grace indulged in a peal of low, soft
laughter. "You funny girl!" she said. "I
am glad indeed that they are not so silly, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
what in the world could I do with so many
lovers? One is quite a plentiful supply for
me."</p>

<p>"That's right, Gracie," exclaimed Evelyn.
"I'm sure one such as mine should be quite
enough for anybody."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not going to say 'Uncle Harold'
any more," laughed Lucilla.</p>

<p>"No, he doesn't want either of us to," said
Grace. "But now I suppose both he and papa
would say I must try to go at once to sleep."</p>

<p>"Yes; so I'll stop hugging and kissing you,
and be quiet as a mouse, getting ready for bed,
so as not to keep you awake," said Lucilla, giving
her a final loving embrace, then gliding
away from the bed to the toilet table.</p>

<p>"Do you think Max will like it?" asked
Evelyn, in an undertone.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. He and Harold have always
been good friends. But as papa says, it will
make an unpleasant mixture of relationships.
He will be brother-in-law to Grace besides
being her own father," she added, with a slight
laugh; "yet I know very well she will always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
remember that he is her father&mdash;her dearly
loved and honored father."</p>

<p>"I am certain of it," said Evelyn; "and
that she would never make the match without
her father's knowledge and consent."</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" responded Lucilla, turning
a loving look upon the now sleeping Grace.</p>

<p>Lucilla had scarcely left her father on the
porch when Violet joined him there.</p>

<p>"I thought it possible, Levis, that you might
not object to your wife's company in your walk
here," she said in a lively tone, and slipping
her hand into his arm.</p>

<p>"Object, my darling, light of my eyes and
joy of my heart!" he said in a loving, mirthful
tone, bending down to kiss the sweet lips.
"Yours is the sweetest companionship I know
of. I should be glad to think mine was as
delightful to you."</p>

<p>"As I don't know how to measure either
one, I can only say that it is the most
delightful of all in the world to me,"
she returned with a happy laugh. Then in a
somewhat graver tone, "Oh, my dear husband,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
you don't know how dearly I and all your children
love you! Neither Elsie nor Ned is ever
willing to go to bed without your fatherly
good-night caresses, and they always bewail
the necessity for doing that when you are
away from home."</p>

<p>"Probably not regretting it more than their
father does," he said. "Yes, the love of my
children is a highly esteemed blessing to me,
and, unfortunately, I cannot help feeling it
something of a grief and disappointment when
I learn that their tenderest affection has been
transferred to another."</p>

<p>"Ah, you are thinking of Grace and Harold.
But be comforted, my dear; I am certain
that Grace does not love her father less because
Harold has won a place in her heart. I
do not love my dear mother any the less for
loving you, my dear husband, or you any the
less for loving her."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it, my darling," he said,
tenderly pressing the hand she had laid in his.</p>

<p>"And surely we cannot blame my brother
and your daughter for loving each other when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
they are both so worthy of affection that no
one who knows them can help giving it to
them."</p>

<p>"You are a special pleader, my dear," he said
with a smile; "and they hardly need one with
me, for I am fond of them both&mdash;particularly
of my frail young daughter."</p>

<p>"Ah, and does not that cause you to rejoice
that she loves, and is beloved by, a good and
successful physician?"</p>

<p>"That is a cause for thankfulness, my
dear," he returned pleasantly. "But shall we
not go in now and retire to rest? It is growing
late."</p>

<p>"Yes, if you have finished your evening
promenade; I don't want to rob you of
that."</p>

<p>"I think I have taken sufficient exercise,
and now prefer rest and sleep," he answered
laughingly, as he drew her on toward the doorway.</p>

<p>As Lucilla came tripping down the stairway
the next morning, Harold was passing through
the lower hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-morning, Lu," he said, looking up at
her.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Dr. Travilla," she returned
demurely.</p>

<p>"What!" he exclaimed, "what's that you
are calling me?"</p>

<p>"Dr. Travilla. That's your name, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;to strangers and people not related
to me; but&mdash;you called me 'uncle' yesterday."</p>

<p>"But you're not my uncle, and it seems you
intend to become my brother-in-law, so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So Harold without the 'uncle' would be
the most appropriate name, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, if&mdash;if you won't think it disrespectful."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. Call me Harold, or I'll
be very apt to call you Mrs. Dinsmore one of
these days."</p>

<p>They ended with a laugh and cordial handshaking,
just as the captain appeared in the
outer doorway. Then they joined him in a
stroll about the grounds.</p>

<p>"There is a dark cloud in the east," remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Lucilla, in a regretful tone; "we are
likely to have a rainy day, are we not, papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "but it need not necessarily
be an unpleasant one. We may find plenty of
indoor employment and recreations."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Harold, "there have been many
pleasant rainy days in my past experiences.
And they are not so bad for a strong, healthy
man, even if he must go out in the rain."</p>

<p>"And when gardens and fields are needing
rain, we long and pray for it," added Lucilla.</p>

<p>"How is Grace this morning?" asked
Harold.</p>

<p>"She was still sleeping when I left the
room," replied Lucilla; "but probably she is
up and ready for the call to breakfast by this
time."</p>

<p>"And there it is," said the captain, as the
sound of the ringing of a hand-bell came from
the house; "so let us go in and not keep the
others waiting."</p>

<p>They met Violet and Grace in the hall as
they entered, and it was pretty to see the
latter's blush and smile as Harold greeted her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>The clouds were increasing and growing
darker, and before they left the table the rain
had begun to fall. So they talked of indoor
occupations and amusements.</p>

<p>"We might have a little fun, if everybody's
willing," remarked Ned Raymond, giving Mr.
Lilburn a significant look and smile.</p>

<p>"Yes; little boys&mdash;big ones too&mdash;can generally
get up some fun among themselves when
they try," was Cousin Ronald's answering remark,
without the slightest indication that he
took Ned's hint.</p>

<p>"And I know Cousin Ronald is very kind
about helping in that," returned Ned insinuatingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is fond of giving pleasure to his
young friends," remarked Mrs. Lilburn, with
a loving smile up into her husband's face. "I
think, Ned, he will help you to some before the
day is over."</p>

<p>They were on the porch, for there was no
wind at the moment to drive the rain in upon
them, and it was cooler there than within
doors. As Annis finished speaking there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
a sudden cry of distress, seemingly coming
from the river just below. "Help! help! I
shall drown! nobody will help me!"</p>

<p>It was a man's voice and there was a foreign
accent in the tones. It made quite a stir in
the little assembly on the porch, the lads exclaiming:
"Oh, the poor fellow! Can't we
help him, Grandma Elsie? Surely the men
on the <i>Dolphin</i> will do what they can!" But
hardly were the words spoken when another
voice called out in reply to the first:</p>

<p>"Hould on there, me jewel, an' I'll give ye
a lift. I'm the b'ye that kin do it."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope he will get him out!" cried
Ned, in great excitement. "Papa, you'll let
them take him on board the yacht, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, if he wishes to be taken there,"
replied the captain, with a smiling glance at
Cousin Ronald.</p>

<p>Just then the second voice called out,
"Here he is&mdash;the half drownded Frenchman;
an' now will the likes of yees aboord that craft
take 'im in an' dry 'im off?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course; that's exactly what the captain
would do if he were here," answered a third
voice, which sounded exactly like that of the
man at present in charge of the yacht.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm glad he didn't drown!" exclaimed
Elsie Raymond, with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"I presume such people don't often drown,
Elsie dear," laughed her mother.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, I often hear of people drowning,"
said the little girl. "And, Uncle Harold,
don't they need a doctor when they are
nearly drowned?"</p>

<p>"They are very apt to," he replied with a
slight laugh. "Do you want me to go down
now and see about that man?"</p>

<p>"If you could, without getting wet," she answered
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Suppose I go," said her Uncle Herbert;
"I'm pretty well now, and am perhaps
almost as skilful a physician as my older
brother."</p>

<p>But now the captain interposed.</p>

<p>"I can't have either of my young brothers
expose himself to this rain, for the men on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
yacht are quite competent to deal with that
Frenchman's case."</p>

<p>"I should say so indeed," said Mr. Lilburn
gravely, "for it is not likely that he was in the
water many minutes. So, my wee bonny
bairnie Elsie, dinna fash yersel' ony mair aboot
him," he concluded, with an affectionate
look and smile into the face of the little
girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, Cousin Ronald, did you do it all?" exclaimed
Ned. "Dear me, how stupid I am!
I might have known it was you."</p>

<p>"I doubt if you really know it yet, laddie,"
laughed the old gentleman.</p>

<p>Ned turned to his father. "Papa, may I
take an umbrella and just run down to the
<i>Dolphin</i> for a few minutes to ask about it?"</p>

<p>"It is not worth while," replied the captain;
"I am very sure you would make no discoveries."</p>

<p>"Then it was you, Cousin Ronald, wasn't
it, now? Please own up," exclaimed Ned,
with a laughing look into the old gentleman's
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>"Folk shouldna find fault with what they've
asked for," was the old gentleman's non-committal
rejoinder.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir! no indeed! but I was not meaning
to find fault," laughed Ned; "I think it
was good fun, and hope you will give us more
of it."</p>

<p>Just as he pronounced the last word a fierce
bark, seemingly that of a very large dog, followed
instantly by a scream as if a woman
were in pain and terror, startled them all,
and there were outcries of affright from the
children, while several of the grown people
started to their feet and looked anxiously in
the direction of the sounds, which had seemed
to come from the vicinity of the porch,
but a little farther toward the rear of the
house.</p>

<p>Another bark from the dog, then a woman's
voice in tones of wild affright, "Oh, somebody
help, help! this dog will tear me to
pieces."</p>

<p>Mr. Leland and Walter Travilla stepped
quickly to the end of the porch nearest the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
sounds and looked around the corner of the
house, but instantly reported that neither
woman nor dog was to be seen.</p>

<p>"Oh, another sell from Cousin Ronald!"
laughed Ned. "Oh, there it is again!" for
just then there was a sound as of a loud knock
at a side door, and a man's coarse voice thundering,
"Let me in oot o' this rain, ye slowgoing,
good-for-naught biddies. Let me in, I
say, and be quick about it."</p>

<p>A woman's scream followed instantly, "Oh,
captain, or some o' you gentlemen, come
here quick and save us from this drunken
rascal."</p>

<p>Some of those on the porch were a little
startled for an instant, but a laugh quickly
followed, and the fun went on for some
minutes&mdash;bees, mice, chickens, and puppies
being heard, but not seen or felt.</p>

<p>But the rainfall was growing heavier, and at
length Harold suggested that it might be well
for Grace, if not for all, to go within doors to
escape the dampness.</p>

<p>Nearly all at once complied with the suggestion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
and Mrs. Travilla, inviting Grace to a seat
by her side, said low and tenderly:</p>

<p>"Harold gave me a piece of news last night
that has made me very happy. I hope one of
these days to number you among my dear
daughters, and shall feel most happy in doing
so."</p>

<p>"Oh, Grandma Elsie, it is so kind in you to
say that!" returned Grace tremulously, but
blushing with pleasure as she spoke; "it will
be very sweet to have you for my mother, for
I have loved you dearly ever since I first saw
you."</p>

<p>At that moment Walter came and took a
seat on the other side of her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Gracie," he said in an undertone, "I
am so glad of Harold's news&mdash;that I am to
have you for a sister at some future day. I'll
try to be a good brother to you."</p>

<p>"And I certainly intend to do my best to be
a good sister to you, Walter," she answered in
the same low tone, and with a vivid blush and
one of her sweetest smiles.</p>

<p>"Thanks," he said. "I wish the wedding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
was to take place directly; some time this fall,
at least. Couldn't we coax your father to allow
it?"</p>

<p>She laughed and shook her head. "Papa
would never allow it, and I&mdash;don't believe I
could consent myself. Really, the very thought
of doing anything so important so suddenly
more than half frightens me."</p>

<p>"Harold is a mild, good-natured kind of fellow;
you needn't be afraid of him," laughed
Walter.</p>

<p>"No, not of him exactly," returned Grace,
laughing a little also and blushing quite a good
deal, "but of&mdash;of the sudden change in my
way of life&mdash;leaving my father and all the rest
of my family."</p>

<p>But there the talk between them ended for
the time, for Harold's near relatives came up,
one after another, to tell Grace how welcome a
new member of their near connection she
would be. Chester Dinsmore was the only
one who expressed any regret, and that not to
Grace, but to Lucilla.</p>

<p>"I am sorry for my brother Frank," he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
"He has been desperately in love with her, but
your father would not let him speak. And I
thought it would be pleasant to be so closely
and doubly connected&mdash;two sisters marrying
brothers."</p>

<p>"I am sorry, since it disappoints you," said
Lucilla. "But I hope Frank will soon get
over his disappointment and find some one who
will suit him still better. Besides, Grace being
so delicate, it is well for her to get into the
hands of a good physician."</p>

<p>"True enough," returned Chester, "and we
may as well look at it in that way, for there is
no use in fretting over what can't be helped."</p>

<p>September had come; the summer heat was
over and business called the gentlemen
of our party to their more southern homes.
Preparations began, and one little company
after another departed, leaving the rest feeling
somewhat lonely and dull without them. The
captain and his family, Grandma Elsie, Evelyn,
and Mr. and Mrs. Lilburn were to go in the
yacht, which carried them away a few days
later&mdash;down the Hudson River and down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Atlantic coast to the seaport near their Southern
homes.</p>

<p>A joyous welcome from lovers, relatives, and
friends awaited them there. Then followed
the fall, winter, and early spring months, filled
up and made delightful by the accustomed
round of study, needlework, social calls, and
visits, interspersed with religious duties and
charitable work, etc.</p>

<p>Evelyn was often at Woodburn, and she and
Lucilla made many pretty things for the
adornment of their future homes. The weddings
were to be postponed till Max came home,
and to their disappointment that home-coming
was deferred month after month till Chester
grew exceedingly weary of waiting.
Letters were received occasionally from Max,
but he knew no more than they when he would
be able to rejoin them and claim his bonny
bride. The waiting was doubtless harder for
him than for Chester or either of the girls.
They indeed seemed to take it quietly and contentedly.</p>

<p>Grace was very happy with her lover close at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
hand and often visiting her professionally or
otherwise. And with her this state of things
seemed to be conducive to health; she grew
rosier, stronger, gayer, and more lively in her
speech and manner than she had ever been before.
So great a joy was it to her father to
perceive the change that he soon fully forgave
Harold for seeking her affection while she was
still so young and feeble. Harold seemed to
be waiting very patiently, and when Chester
grumbled at his long enforced wait, Lucilla
sometimes playfully called his attention to the
good example set him by Harold.</p>

<p>"But there isn't the same need of waiting in
our case," he would reply, "for, I am thankful
to say, you are as healthy a girl as any that
I know of."</p>

<p>"Yes; but think of the disappointment to
Max and Eva if we shouldn't wait for them,
when we can be together almost as much as if
we were married, and all the time doing things
to make our new home as lovely as possible."</p>

<p>The continuance of war in the Philippines, a
cause of more or less regret to everybody, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
doubly so to Max's friends and relatives, because
it delayed his return month after month.
They missed him particularly when Christmas
time came and he was not there to share
in the pleasant exchange of gifts and greetings.
They had sent gifts to him, hoping they
would reach him in good season, and as usual
they bestowed them upon each other. For
weeks beforehand Violet had spent a good deal
of time in her studio, and the result was a
handsome portrait of the captain for each of
his older daughters. They were highly pleased
with them, saying that nothing else could have
given them so much pleasure. The captain's
gifts to them and Violet were valuable books
and some fine paintings for their walls.</p>

<p>"You see, Chester," Lucilla said, when exhibiting
hers to him, "that we are getting
more and more for the adornment of our home
while we wait for it."</p>

<p>"Adornment which could go on just as well
if we were already in it," he returned, with a
rather rueful laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, for your consolation please remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
that it is near enough to be looked at every
day," replied Lucilla, in a sprightly tone.
"And see here what your <i>fiancée</i> has prepared
for you," drawing a small package from her
pocket as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Thanks! Some of her own work, I hope,"
he said, with a gratified look and smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, I would have you enjoy as much of
my work as possible."</p>

<p>He had it opened now, and found it a beaded
purse.</p>

<p>"Oh, how handsome!" he cried. "Many,
many thanks, dearest! I have no need of a
reminder of you, but if I had, this would be one
every time I looked at it. Now here is my gift
to you," taking in his turn a little package
from his pocket and putting it in her hand.
It was a miniature of himself&mdash;a fine likeness&mdash;attached
to a beautiful gold chain.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is excellent, and nothing could have
pleased me better!" she exclaimed, as she
examined it.</p>

<p>Harold had the same sort of gift for Grace,
and she had embroidered for him a set of fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
linen cambric handkerchiefs, with which he
seemed greatly pleased.</p>

<p>Every member of that family, and each of
the others in the connection, had prepared
some gift of more or less value for each of the
others, for their servants and dependents, and
for the neighbors poor enough to need assistance
from those able to give it.</p>

<p>As usual there was a grand dinner at Ion, to
which all the connection were invited; and
pretty much the same thing was repeated at
Woodburn on New Year's day. Max was
missed and talked of at both gatherings, always
being mentioned as one of whom they were
proud and fond, while to Evelyn and the
Woodburn family his absence detracted much
from the enjoyment of the festivities. Yet
they comforted themselves with the hope that
the trouble in the Philippines would soon be
over, and he allowed to return to his home and
dear ones, now so anxious to see him, and to
claim his promised wife.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> winter passed away without any untoward
event to our friends at Woodburn, Ion,
Fairview, and the vicinity; March and April
succeeded, then early in May came the news
that Admiral Watson was ordered to proceed
to Manila and relieve Admiral Dewey. He
sailed from San Francisco on the 16th. It
was not until late in June that he reached his
destination, but Admiral Dewey had left there
for Hong-Kong on the 23d of May, and placed
the <i>Olympia</i> in dry-dock for the ten days
he thought best to stay at that point in order
to recruit his own health and that of his men.
He left Hong-Kong on June 6, and reached
Singapore June 11. On the 23d he was at
Colombo, on the island of Ceylon. He
touched at various points on his homeward
route&mdash;Port Said, Trieste, Naples, Leghorn&mdash;at
every place being received with highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
honors. On August 28 he was in the neighborhood
of Nice and Villefranche, enjoying
the delightful climate and beautiful scenery
of that part of the world. On the 4th of September
he reached Gibraltar. His vessel gave
the usual salute, heartily acknowledged by the
garrison, and the admiral was warmly welcomed
by its commander-in-chief, General
Biddulph. He seems to have stayed there six
days, as it was on the 10th he sailed for New
York by way of the Azores. On Tuesday
morning, September 26, he anchored inside
Sandy Hook&mdash;three days earlier than he was
expected.</p>

<p>A reception committee in New York City
had been busily making ready to give him a
grand "Welcome Home," which they intended
should eclipse in gorgeous pageantry everything
that had preceded it in the way of public
demonstration. They had written to Admiral
Dewey to know when he would arrive in
order that they might fix a date for the grand
display, and he had written them from Leghorn,
more than a month before: "I shall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
without fail, reach the Lower Bay on Friday,
September 29."</p>

<p>The glad news of his arrival quickly spread
by telegraph, and cannon were fired and bells
rung in many cities throughout the country.
The New York Reception Committee hastened
to welcome him as soon as they knew of the
arrival of the <i>Olympia</i>. Rear-Admirals
Philip and Sampson came also; but first of all
came Sir Thomas Lipton, the British challenger
for the cup which has been so long in
our possession, his vessel lying near where the
<i>Olympia</i> anchored.</p>

<p>But presently another yacht came steaming
rapidly down the river, and Max recognized it
with an exclamation of delight, for it was the
<i>Dolphin</i>, and in a few minutes more Captain
Raymond was on the deck of the <i>Olympia</i>,
grasping his son's hand, while his eyes shone
with fatherly pride and affection.</p>

<p>"My boy, my dear boy!" he said, in tones
tremulous with emotion; "thank God that we
are permitted to meet again."</p>

<p>"Father, my dear, dear father, how I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
longed for this meeting with you!" was Max's
answering exclamation. "Oh, tell me, are all
our dear ones alive and well?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my son, and waiting yonder in the
yacht for you. Surely the admiral will allow
you to go aboard her with me for a little visit."</p>

<p>The admiral and the captain were not strangers
to each other. A cordial greeting passed
between them, they chatted as old friends for
a few minutes, then Captain Raymond carried
his son off to the <i>Dolphin</i>, where he was received
most joyfully, and exchanged loving
embraces with his affianced, his sisters,
"Mamma Vi," "Grandma Elsie," and little
brother.</p>

<p>They told him they had spent the greater
part of the summer at Crag Cottage&mdash;which
they still considered their temporary home&mdash;but
for the present were on board the yacht,
as the best place from which to view the naval
welcome to Admiral Dewey.</p>

<p>Time flew fast in the glad mutual intercourse
they had lacked for so many months. Max
had many questions to ask in regard to friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
and relatives and all that had been going on in
the neighborhood of his home and theirs. But
his short leave had soon expired, and his
father conveyed him back to the <i>Olympia</i> and
left him there with the warmly expressed hope
that they would soon be able to be together
constantly for a time.</p>

<p>At the naval anchorage at Tompkinsville a
fleet was gathered to welcome Dewey's return,
and his vessel steamed thither on Wednesday&mdash;the
day after her arrival at Sandy Hook.
As she swept up the bay the salute due to an
Admiral of the United States Navy rang out
over the harbor from the forts and the assembled
fleet for the first time in many years.
There were also the music of marine bands,
the pealing of naval bugles, the shrill whistles
of numerous small craft, the cheering of excursion
parties, and the rapid dash of the
steam launches, all combining to make the
scene a very lively one.</p>

<p>During that day and the next the admiral
and his officers had little rest, for their time
was devoted to receiving the hurried visits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
State and city officials, of naval and military
officers, and of thousands of private citizens.
One of the calls was that of a committee from
Washington, to tell Dewey of the arrangements
for his reception and the sword presentation
there, and of an invitation to dine with President
McKinley on October 3d.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Captain Lamberton of the
<i>Olympia</i> had a pleasant task&mdash;that of pinning
upon the breast of each man of Dewey's fleet
who had taken part in the fight at Manila the
bronze medal of honor voted him by Congress.
That was followed by the presentation to Admiral
Dewey of the first American admiral's
flag ever flung to the breeze, the flag first
hoisted to the mast-head of Farragut's flagship,
the <i>Hartford</i>, before New Orleans.</p>

<p>Another thing very pleasing to the admiral
was the receipt of an order from Washington
granting special permission to the thirty-four
Chinamen on board of the <i>Olympia</i> who had
taken part in the battle at Manila to land and
have a share in the great parade. The city
was a blaze of flags and bunting by day, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
electric lights by night. On the Brooklyn
Bridge over eight thousand electric bulbs were
arranged to form the words "Welcome
Dewey"; powerful searchlights flashed from
the towers over city and bay, and red fire
burned along shores on the vessels at night.</p>

<p>The naval parade on Friday was the
most magnificent display of the kind ever seen
in this country. The <i>Olympia</i> led the way,
followed by battleships, cruisers, revenue
cutters, torpedo boats, and innumerable craft
of all descriptions. Over three million people
lined the river banks to see the magnificent
pageant. At Riverside&mdash;where Grant is
buried&mdash;a salute was fired in his honor. Two
beautiful allegorical floats were anchored there,
representing "Victory" and "Peace." Here
the <i>Olympia</i> and her consorts dropped anchor,
while the long fleet passed in review. In the
evening there was a fine electric and pyrotechnic
display throughout the city and along
the river.</p>

<p>The next day, Saturday, September 30, came
the land parade, which was as interesting as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
had been the naval one. At five o'clock the
admiral was up, and personally inspected his
men. A committee of gentlemen escorted him
to the City Hall, where he was met by Admiral
Schley, Captain Walker, Captain Coghlan,
Captain Dyer, Governor Roosevelt, and others
who had won distinction in the war. It was
observed that he greeted Schley with marked
cordiality. From there the party went to a
stand in front of the Hall, and Dewey was presented
by Mayor Van Wyck, on behalf of the
City of New York, with a handsome and costly
loving cup of fine gold.</p>

<p>The admiral and his party then hastened to
the pier to take the boat to Grant's tomb,
where the procession formed. It was a great
one, and every step of the way was an ovation.
First came Sousa's immense band of musicians,
then the sailor boys of Manila, the bluejackets
of Santiago, and the boys from fifteen States,
who had taken part in the Spanish-American
war. The immense crowds along the sidewalks
cheered them lustily; none more so than the
"Fighting Tenth" of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>But the part of the procession which attracted
the most attention was the carriage
drawn by four beautiful bay horses in which
rode Admiral Dewey and Mayor Van Wyck.
Dewey rode with uncovered head bowing right
and left until he reached the reviewing stand.
The triumphal arch with its marble-like colonnade
made a beautiful picture. On its top was
a heroic figure of Farragut&mdash;who gave Dewey
his first lesson in sailing over hidden mines
and destructive torpedoes&mdash;seeming to look
down upon his brave and successful pupil with
admiration and approval. The celebration
was a great success, showing how heartily the
American people appreciated their gallant
hero. The next day, being the Sabbath, was
spent in rest and comparative quiet. On Monday,
October 2, Dewey went by rail from New
York to Washington, his journey thither proving
a continual ovation. It was in the early
evening he reached that city, and as the train
neared the station a battery boomed out the
admiral's salute, announcing his arrival to the
waiting multitudes. The Third Cavalry was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
there to receive him, and he was driven to the
White House to pay his respects to the Chief
of the Nation. He was warmly welcomed by
the President and his Cabinet and many naval
officers.</p>

<p>After that the entire party went to review
the civic parade which had been planned in
honor of the admiral.</p>

<p>The next day Admiral Dewey was presented
with the sword voted him by Congress. A
vast concourse of people assembled to witness
the imposing and impressive ceremony, which
took place in front of the Capitol, in the presence
of the President and his Cabinet and the
principal officers of the several departments of
the government. General Miles was grand
marshal of the escort, attended by a large staff
of officers of the army and navy, all in full
dress uniform and superbly mounted.</p>

<p>Just as the meridian gun sounded high noon,
Admiral Dewey, leaning upon the President's
arm, walked upon the platform. Following
them were judges of the Supreme Court, governors
of States, senators, and members of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Congress, and the general officers of the army
and navy.</p>

<p>Congress had directed that the sword should
be presented by the Secretary of the Navy, and
he did so in most appropriate and eloquent
language.</p>

<p>"No captain," he said, "ever faced a more
crucial test than when, that morning, bearing
the fate and the honor of your country in your
hand, thousands of miles from home, with
every foreign port in the world shut to you,
nothing between you and annihilation but the
thin sheathing of your ships, your cannon, and
your devoted officers and men, you moved upon
the enemy's batteries on shore and on sea with
unflinching faith and nerve, and before the
sun was halfway up in the heavens had silenced
the guns of the foe, sunk the hostile fleet,
demonstrated the supremacy of the American
sea power, and transferred to the United States
an entire of the islands of the Pacific."</p>

<p>In closing his speech the Secretary handed
the sword to the President as Commander-in
Chief of the Army and Navy, and the President,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
speaking a few appropriate words as he
did so, handed it to the admiral, who took it,
saving:</p>

<p>"I thank you, Mr. President, for this great
honor you have conferred upon me. I thank
the Congress for what it has done. I thank
the Secretary of the Navy for his gracious
words. I thank my country for this beautiful
gift, which shall be an heirloom in my family
forever, as an evidence that republics are not
ungrateful. And I thank you, Mr. Chairman
and gentlemen of the committee, for the gracious,
kindly, and cordial welcome which you
have given me to my home."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a lovely evening, and a pleasant company
had gathered upon the deck of the <i>Dolphin</i>,
Captain Raymond's yacht, lying in New
York harbor; there were Mrs. Travilla, or
Grandma Elsie, as some of her loved ones called
her, Captain Raymond himself, his wife and
children, older and younger, Evelyn Leland,
Dr. Harold Travilla, and Chester Dinsmore.
They were scattered in groups&mdash;the three pairs
of lovers in one, and conversing in low, earnest
tones, now and then varied by a ripple of
laughter.</p>

<p>"I should like it very, very much," said Eva,
"but doubt if the captain proves willing."</p>

<p>"Doubtless if he consulted only his own inclination
he would not consent," said Max;
"but father is anything else but selfish, and
loves you so dearly, Eva, that I by no means
despair of persuading him to give you your
wish in regard to this."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have hardly a doubt of that," said Lucilla,
"and I am highly in favor of the plan,
though I was not at first."</p>

<p>"It suits me exactly," remarked Chester, in
a gleeful tone. "I greatly like the idea of taking
my wife home with me."</p>

<p>"Something that more than one of us
would be glad to do," sighed Harold, squeezing
affectionately a little hand of which he had
taken possession a moment before.</p>

<p>"Never mind, old fellow, your turn will
come one of these days, I hope," said Chester.
"Perhaps when you two have waited as long as
Lu and I have now."</p>

<p>"Ah, I'm afraid we have even a longer wait
than that before us," returned Harold.</p>

<p>"But we can see each other every day&mdash;be
together a good deal of the time," remarked
Grace, in low, soothing tones.</p>

<p>"Well, let us have the thing settled, by hearing
what father has to say about it," said Max,
for at that moment the captain might be seen
approaching their group.</p>

<p>"About what, my son?" he asked, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
took a vacant seat close at hand, for he had
overheard the last few words.</p>

<p>"As to the place where our nuptials should
be celebrated, sir," returned Max, with a little,
happy laugh.</p>

<p>"Where else but in your homes?" asked his
father. "I should like to have both my children
married in my house, but Eva and you, I
suppose, would prefer to have yours and hers
in her home&mdash;Fairview."</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Evelyn, "my very strong
wish is to have mine celebrated in my own old
home&mdash;the house my father built and owned&mdash;Crag
Cottage."</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear child, that is natural!" returned
the captain in a tone of mingled surprise
and acquiescence, "and I should be loath
to stand in the way of such a wish. But I
thought you and Lucilla were planning to have
but one ceremony for the two couples of you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; and since talking it over we have
concluded that Crag Cottage would be a suitable
place for it, if you do not object."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that there are reasons both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
for and against it," he said thoughtfully, "but
since you four are the ones most nearly concerned,
I think it will be only right and kind
to let you decide the question among yourselves.
But it is growing late in the season,
and if the ceremony is to be performed here at
the North, it should take place quite soon.
Can you make needed preparations in a few
days?"</p>

<p>"I think we can," both girls answered to
that question.</p>

<p>"Very well, then, so far as I am concerned
you shall do just as you please. For that
matter, you are all of legal age to do so
whether you have my permission or not."</p>

<p>At that all four instantly disclaimed any intention
or desire to go contrary to his wishes,
and Eva added:</p>

<p>"I shall of course write at once to my uncle
and aunt asking their consent and approval;
for, though of legal age, I owe to them more
than that for the great kindness they have
shown me ever since the death of my dear
father."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is a right feeling you have toward
them," remarked Captain Raymond, in a tone
of commendation, "but I have no idea that
they will oppose your wishes in the least in this
matter."</p>

<p>"No, I am almost sure they will not," she
said; "but I shall write them to-night, and
hope for a prompt reply. There will be some
necessary shopping to do, and New York City
will be the best place for that."</p>

<p>"Decidedly," assented the captain, "and you
could have no better helpers in that than my
wife and her mother."</p>

<p>"And yourself, papa," laughed Lucilla.</p>

<p>"As purse-bearer?" he asked, with a smile.
"I shall certainly be that, and ready to exercise
my taste as regards the choice of the
goods."</p>

<p>"And I may be the housekeeper here on the
<i>Dolphin</i> while you are away on your pleasant
errands, I suppose," said Grace.</p>

<p>"Yes, if you like, daughter," returned the
captain; and Harold added, "And I as your
assistant, if you are willing to make use of me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"To see to it that she does not overwork
herself," said the captain.</p>

<p>"And what may Chester and I be allowed to
do?" queried Max.</p>

<p>"To keep them company,&mdash;if they desire
it,&mdash;manage the vessel, and keep the children
out of mischief, especially from falling overboard,
and entertained in harmless ways."</p>

<p>"I think we can do all that," said Max; "but
how long do you expect to be absent, father?
Are we to lie still in the harbor here till you
return?"</p>

<p>"Just as you please," said his father. "If
you choose to steam along the shores, out into
the ocean or up the river, you have full liberty
to do so. All I ask is that you take good care
of the children and the vessel."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I think that with Chester's and
Harold's help I can engage to do all that,"
laughed Max. "Don't you think so, lads?"
turning first to one, then to the other of the
young men.</p>

<p>Both returned an affirmative reply, then
they all joined the group of older ladies, told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
of their plans and purposes, and asked for advice,
and whether the assistance they wanted
in their shopping might be confidently expected.</p>

<p>At first both ladies were surprised that the
young people should think of having their weddings
before returning home, but, after a little
discussion, highly approved of the plan, and
expressed themselves as willing as possible to
assist in the shopping and all needful preparations.
Then they discussed the question what
it would be needful or advisable to purchase,
what dresses should be made and where the
work could be done in the speediest and most
approved manner, as it was wisest and best to
consider and decide upon these matters before
setting out to do their errands.</p>

<p>Evelyn wrote her letter to her uncle and aunt
before retiring for the night, and had it posted
early the next morning. Shortly after breakfast
the shopping party went into the city on
their pleasant errand, and a little later the
<i>Dolphin</i> weighed anchor and steamed out of
harbor, going seaward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>The party on its deck was a cheerful, even
merry one, Max and Chester rejoicing in the
near approach of their long looked-for nuptials;
Harold happy in having full possession
for the time of his affianced, and Elsie and Ned
Raymond in gay, youthful spirits, for they
loved to be on the yacht and with Brother Max,
Uncle Harold, and also Chester, with whom
they had become almost as free and affectionate
as if he were an own brother.</p>

<p>"Where are we going now, Brother Max?"
asked Ned.</p>

<p>"I think we will put it to vote," replied
Max. "My idea is that it might be very pleasant
to steam along near the shore of the Sound
on one side going out, and on the other returning;
so getting a view of the country on both.
Grace, as you are the only lady present, I
think you should have the first vote. Shall we
do as I have proposed, or something different?"</p>

<p>"It sounds very pleasant, Max," replied
Grace, "but I don't wish to decide the question,
for I shall enjoy going anywhere in the
<i>Dolphin</i>, and with such pleasant company."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rather non-committal," laughed Max.
"Well, Chester and Harold, what do you
say?"</p>

<p>Both answered that they approved his plan,
and would like nothing better, and Elsie and
Ned exclaimed with enthusiasm that <i>they</i>
would like nothing better.</p>

<p>"A unanimous vote in favor," commented
Max, "so the thing is settled."</p>

<p>"And we can settle to something," remarked
Elsie, in a tone of satisfaction;
"Uncle Harold, don't you want to tell us about
some of the poor wounded or sick fellows you
attended in Cuba?"</p>

<p>"I fear I have not much to tell of them&mdash;seeing
I have already told so much&mdash;except
that they were wonderfully brave and patient,
full of love for their country and compassion
for the downtrodden, inhumanly treated
Cubans," replied Dr. Travilla.</p>

<p>"I think our soldiers were very brave, patient,
and uncomplaining," said Elsie. "I am
very proud of them, especially because they
didn't do cruel deeds such as I have read of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
soldiers of other nations doing in time of
war."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think they deserved that commendation,"
said Harold. "And the attempt of
Hobson and his men to block the entrance to
Santiago harbor by sinking the <i>Merrimac</i> there
was brave as brave could be. We have indeed
cause to be proud of our soldiers."</p>

<p>"And so we are!" cried Ned enthusiastically,
"and," turning toward his brother, "just
as proud of the brave fellows that were at
Manila as of those in Cuba."</p>

<p>"Thank you, young man," returned Max,
with a bow and a smile. "We certainly have
every reason to believe that our doings there
have been appreciated by our kind countrymen."</p>

<p>"Brother Max, could you help feeling a little
bit afraid when your ship went into that long
channel with its many forts and torpedoes?"</p>

<p>"I certainly cannot say that I was entirely
free from fear," acknowledged Max; "but I had
no desire to escape the danger by giving up my
part in the coming fight, for I felt that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
were on the right side of it&mdash;undertaken for
the oppressed&mdash;and that my Heavenly Father
was able to protect me, and all of us."</p>

<p>"And he did," exclaimed Elsie, in joyful
tones; "it was just wonderful how you all escaped
being killed, and only a few were slightly
wounded."</p>

<p>"It was indeed," assented Max, "and a great
cause for thankfulness."</p>

<p>"Do you like Admiral Dewey, Brother
Max?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes indeed!" was the earnest, smiling
reply. "He is determined with his men, but
very kind-hearted. The man who has been
guilty of a fault may be pretty sure of pardon
if he confesses it, but not if he tells a falsehood
to escape his deserts. Lying is a thing
which Dewey utterly detests."</p>

<p>"I wish I could get acquainted with him,"
said Elsie; "though I suppose he wouldn't like
to be bothered with talking to a little girl of
my age."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," laughed Max;
"he is said to be very fond of children."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>"Has he any of his own?" she asked, with a
look of interest.</p>

<p>"One son; but he is grown up and is in business."</p>

<p>"Oh, do tell me what sort of folks the Filipinos
are?"</p>

<p>"I will do my best," replied Max. "The
men are not tall, but have good forms and well-shaped
heads. Their looks are boyish, and
they seem never to grow old. They have
black, glossy hair that seldom grows gray.
The women are graceful and rather good-looking.
They usually wear their hair loose, and
no hat or bonnet on their heads. Their dress
is a satin skirt handsomely embroidered, and
a waist of pina cloth, having flowing
sleeves. They wear a scarf of the finest
quality, and beautifully embroidered, about
their neck and shoulders. An American lady
there told me that they often spend years on
the embroidery of a single garment, and that
she and others of our ladies had gone into
raptures over that work, but could seldom
secure a specimen. They are very cleanly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
people&mdash;bathe a great deal, and keep their
clothing very clean; their houses also are kept
clean, neat, and tidy. The women sew, spin,
weave, and gather thatch to keep the hut in
repair. They also catch fish for the family to
eat, and are skilful at that business. They
carry burdens on their heads, and that makes
them erect and graceful. A good many of
both Spaniards and Chinamen have married
Filipino women, and the children, called Mestizoes,
make good citizens, seeming to inherit
the patient industry of the Chinese father and
the gentle disposition and dignified self-possession
of the Filipino mother. But now I think
I have done my share of talking for the
present, and must leave the rest of you to do
yours while I see if all is going right with our
vessel," added Max, rising and leaving the
group as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Uncle Harold, do you know the captain
they call 'Fighting Bob'?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"Slightly," returned his uncle, "and a
brave, noble man he is&mdash;a naval officer to be
proud of; perfectly fearless and cool in battle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
kind and helpful to conquered foes. He was
commander of the <i>Iowa</i>, to which the Spanish
ship <i>Vizcaya</i> surrendered. Her captain, in a
speech in Spain, had said that he would tow
back the <i>Iowa</i> to his king; but he was not able
to do so. The <i>Iowa</i> drove shell after shell into
his vessel, till she was a mass of flames, and
struck her flag.</p>

<p>"Then 'Fighting Bob' sent out his boats to
rescue the prisoners on the ship and in the
water, and took back to the <i>Iowa</i> several officers
and two hundred and forty men, her captain,
Eulate, among them. It is said to have
been a horrible scene&mdash;so many dead and
wounded men, and Captain Eulate, limping,
and with his head bound up. He saluted as he
stepped upon the deck of the <i>Iowa</i>, and so did
Captain Evans.</p>

<p>"'You are Captain Evans? This is the
<i>Iowa</i>?' asked Captain Eulate. 'Yes,' said
Captain Evans, and took Eulate's hand in both
of his, shaking it warmly. Eulate stepped
back, unbuckled his sword, kissed it, and with
the most elegant grace, handed it, hilt forward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
to Captain Evans. But he refused to take it,
turning the palm of his hand outward and waving
it back, at the same time shaking his head&mdash;a
very emphatic refusal.</p>

<p>"The Spaniards, officers and men, looked on
in astonishment. Captain Eulate pressed
Captain Evans' hand, and the crew gave Eulate
three cheers, for he had fought well, and
only gave up when his ship was in flames and
sinking.</p>

<p>"Just then a terrific explosion was
heard on the <i>Vizcaya</i>, which was only a short
distance off, and a solid column of smoke went
up nearly four thousand feet, it is said, taking
the form of a gigantic mushroom. At that
Captain Eulate turned around, pointing with
one hand to his ruined ship, with the other
toward his officers and men, '<i>Veeski! Veeski!</i>'
he cried at the top of his voice, while tears
rolled down his cheeks. His men sprang toward
him, and many of them kissed his hand.
He said in Spanish, 'My brave marines!' and
looked away."</p>

<p>"That was a very interesting story, uncle,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
said Elsie, as Dr. Travilla paused. "I hope
there's more of it."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, please go on, Uncle Harold," said
Ned. "Our ships took all the Spanish ones,
didn't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes; the <i>Maria Teresa</i> was now a wreck
also, and the <i>Iowa</i> went to the relief of her
drowning and burning men. Admiral Cervera
was taken prisoner and brought on board the
<i>Iowa</i>. When he stepped aboard, with his staff,
Captain Evans stood with uncovered head, and
the marine guard presented arms. Captain
Eulate stepped toward him, touched his sword
with his hand and pressed it to his breast, crying
out in Spanish, pointing toward Captain
Evans, evidently extolling his bravery and
generosity. The admiral made a courtly bow
to Captain Evans, and shook hands with him.
The rest of the Spanish officers kissed the hand
of the Spanish admiral four times, and embraced
and kissed Captain Eulate. The men
of the crew, too, would now and then see a
comrade whom they had supposed dead, and
they would fall to embracing and kissing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did Captain Evans thank God for his victory,
as Captain Philip did, uncle?" asked
Elsie.</p>

<p>"No; but when some one blamed him for not
having done so, he said that while preparations
were being made for it he found that he was
surrounded by boats carrying dying and
wounded prisoners, and others of the crew of
the <i>Vizcaya</i>, to the number of two hundred and
fifty. 'To leave these men to suffer for want
of food and clothing, while I called my men aft
to offer prayers, was not my idea of either
Christianity or religion,' he wrote in reply. 'I
preferred to clothe the naked, feed the hungry,
and succor the sick, and I am strongly of the
opinion that Almighty God has not put a black
mark against me on account of it. I do not
know whether I shall stand with Captain
Philip among the first chosen in the hereafter,
but I have this to say in conclusion, that every
drop of blood in my body on the afternoon of
July 3d, was singing thanks and praise
to Almighty God for the victory we had
won.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>"They call Captain Evans 'Fighting Bob,'
don't they, uncle?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"Yes; but it is said that he does not like it,
and insists that he is no more of a fighter than
very many of his brother officers. But it is
really used as an honor to one whom his countrymen
admire. But probably he will do no
more fighting, as, by his own request, he has
been detached from the command of the <i>Iowa</i>,
and made a member of the Board of Inspection
and Survey&mdash;a change he was entitled to, having
already served more than his term of sea
duty."</p>

<p>"Oh, uncle!" said Elsie, in a tone of entreaty,
"can't you tell us something more
about Captain Philip? I do like him so, because
of his being such a good Christian man."</p>

<p>"He is that," said Dr. Travilla emphatically,
"and one of the bravest and most modest
of men. When asked for his photograph he
replied that he had never had one taken; and
on being urgently invited to be present at a
reception to Lieutenant Hobson, given in New
York, he shook his head, saying the trial would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
be too much for him. But I dare say his real
reason was a fear that his presence might deprive
the young officer of some of the attention
and honor due to him."</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen him, uncle?" asked
Elsie.</p>

<p>"Yes, once, for a few minutes, and I have
heard him described as mild-mannered, full of
fun, with gray mustache, a kindly face, and
mild blue eyes, and it is said that he is fond of
his men as they are of him. He said to some
one, 'I have a stout ship and a crew of Americans.
So had the other captains. That was
why we won.' He fairly earned his promotion,
first to the rank of commodore, then to
that of admiral.</p>

<p>"Now you two have taken in a good deal of
information; don't you think it might be well
for you to take some exercise in running about
the deck?" concluded Uncle Harold, in a
kindly tone, to which Elsie and Ned responded
with a cheerful, "Yes, sir! Thank you for
the stories," then ran away to carry out his
suggestions, Grace calling after them to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
very careful not to go into any dangerous
place.</p>

<p>"We won't," Ned called back. "We want
to live to go to that double wedding."</p>

<p>"Yes, Ned," said Elsie, in a much lower
tone, "and we want to buy some handsome
presents for the brides. I spoke to mamma
about that, and she said she and papa and
grandma would give us our turn at the business
of shopping; maybe day after to-morrow,
for they expect to come back to the <i>Dolphin</i>
to-morrow evening, and if the weather is suitable
we can go into the city directly after
breakfast the next morning."</p>

<p>"Oh, good!" cried Ned. "Won't it be fun?
I hope papa has plenty of money for us to
spend, so that we can get something very handsome&mdash;jewelry,
perhaps. That will be the
most suitable and acceptable, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Probably," returned Elsie. "Grandma,
papa, and mamma will be the ones to decide."</p>

<p>"Of course," said her brother; "but they'll
let us have some say about it too."</p>

<p>Max and Chester were at the same moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
standing together at some little distance
in a friendly discussion of a similar topic&mdash;what
gifts they should procure for their
brides.</p>

<p>"Jewelry of some sort would, I suppose, be
considered the most appropriate," remarked
Chester half inquiringly.</p>

<p>"That is my idea," returned Max. "I believe
the majority of ladies can hardly have
too much of it&mdash;though I have never noticed
Eva cared very much about it. I think, however,
that Lu does; I know that some years ago
she had a strong desire for more than father
deemed best for her."</p>

<p>"Tastes differ," sagely remarked Chester,
"and I wish to give her whatever she would
prefer."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Max; "that is right and
kind, and just my feeling in regard to the gift
to Eva."</p>

<p>"Well," said Chester, "fortunately we do
not need to decide the question until we see
what the jewellers and other merchants have
to offer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shall we go together to make our selections?"
asked Max.</p>

<p>"I should like to do so, if it suits you; and
to have your father along&mdash;Cousins Elsie and
Violet also, if they feel inclined to go."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" said Max; "for they both
have excellent taste and judgment. I don't
know any one whose opinion on the subject I
should consider more valuable."</p>

<p>"Nor do I," responded Chester. "We are
very fortunate in our lady friends, and I may
well add in gentlemen also, Max&mdash;your father
in especial."</p>

<p>"Thank you," returned Max, with a smile
of gratification; "I think there is not a more
perfect man and gentleman anywhere to be
found; but that may be because I am his
son."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! not altogether, at any rate," said
Chester; "for you are by no means alone in
your favorable opinion."</p>

<p>"No, I flatter myself that I am not. Ah!
do you see how earnestly Harold and Grace are
talking together? I shouldn't wonder if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
are upon the very same subject we have just
been discussing."</p>

<p>"Quite likely. It seems to be the most important
subject for older and younger of our
party at present."</p>

<p>"Yes. By the way, Chester, we are hurrying
matters so that we can hardly hope or expect
to have very many of our Southern relatives
and friends to witness the ceremony."</p>

<p>"No, I suppose we can't. But we might invite
them to visit us in our own house as soon
after we get there as they please," laughed
Chester.</p>

<p>"True enough!" exclaimed Max, looking
highly pleased at the thought, "and how delightful
it would be to entertain them there."</p>

<p>"So I think, and you don't know how I have
wanted a home for that, as well as for my own
private enjoyment."</p>

<p>"I have had some very severe attacks of
homesickness since I left my father's house for
the Naval Academy, so that I think I can
understand your feelings," Max said, with a
smile. "And I expect to be somewhat envious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
of you and Lu some months hence, when I
have to leave wife and home to go&mdash;perhaps
to the other side of the world."</p>

<p>"Yes, Max, when I think of that I am sorry
for you, and for ourselves that we must be so
often deprived of your pleasant society."</p>

<p>They were steaming along within sight of
the shore, and just at that moment the children
came running to ask Max some question
about what could be seen there. He listened
and replied very kindly, Chester now and then
taking part in the talk.</p>

<p>The day and evening passed pleasantly to
all on board; the children retired at their accustomed
early hour, Grace helping Elsie in
preparing for her couch, lest the dear little sister
should miss Mamma too sorely, and wet
her pillow with tears. Ned considered himself
almost a man now, and quite fit to do without
any attention in that line. "I do miss
Mamma," Elsie said, as she laid herself down in
the berth, "but it is very nice to share this
stateroom with you for once, Gracie dear."</p>

<p>"And I am very glad to have you do so,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
replied Grace; "for I shall not miss Lu half
so much with you in her place."</p>

<p>"It's nice and kind in you to say that," returned
Elsie, with a loving look and smile.
"But don't feel as if you must come to bed as
early as I do, but go back and enjoy Brother
Max, Uncle Harold, and Chester a little longer,
for I am sure they want you."</p>

<p>"Well, then I'll kiss you good-night, you
darling little sister, and go back to them for
perhaps another hour," Grace said, accompanying
her words with a tender caress.</p>

<p>She found the gentlemen still on deck, where
she had left them, and they gave her no reason
to doubt that her society was welcome to
them.</p>

<p>An hour was spent in cheerful chat, and
some singing of appropriate songs and hymns,
then they bade good-night, and all retired to
their staterooms, Max having first attended to
all his duties as captain of the vessel.</p>

<p>The night passed quietly, and the next morning
all woke rested and refreshed, ready to enjoy
their breakfast, and after that the walks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
and talks upon deck, varied by resting in
steamer chairs while chatting and gazing out
upon the water and the land, out of sight of
which they seldom were. The weather was all
that could be desired, and they rejoiced in that
fact for both themselves and their friends, the
shoppers.</p>

<p>The latter came on board soon after the
yacht had come to anchor again in New York
harbor. Their bright, cheerful faces told at
once of success with what had been undertaken
and of satisfaction with their purchases,
and their tongues speedily repeated the pleasant
story of beautiful silks, satins, laces and
other trimmings, for in the family circle they
did not care to make a secret of their needful,
or desirable, preparations for the approaching
ceremony.</p>

<p>All passed the night on the vessel, Violet
remarking that one night at the best of
hotels was quite enough for her; she felt so
much more at home on their own delightful
yacht. But shortly after breakfast the children
were taken into the city to select their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
bridal gifts, their father and mother going
along with them. Grace, in compliance with
a suggestion from her father, was quite willing
to entrust the selection of her gifts to him and
Mamma, shopping being always wearisome
work for her.</p>

<p>Grandma Elsie, Evelyn, and Lucilla remained
on the vessel, with Grace, to take
a good rest, while the young men went in
search of their gifts for the brides that were
to be.</p>

<p>"How many dresses did you have fitted?"
asked Grace.</p>

<p>"Two apiece," replied her sister; "our wedding
gowns and one other for each of us. The
others were expressed home at once, to be
made up by our own dressmakers, who, as you
know, have our measures, so that they may be
ready to wear by the time we return, or very
soon after."</p>

<p>"A very good plan, I think," said Grace.
"Eva, have you heard from your uncle and
aunt in reply to your note the other day?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Evelyn replied, with a smile, "and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
I am happy to say that they highly approve of
our plans and purposes&mdash;not bidding me beware
of the truth of the old saying, 'Marry in
haste and repent at leisure,' but promising to
have everything in readiness for us and our
ceremony. Isn't it good of them?"</p>

<p>"Very nice and kind, I think," said Grace.
"How favorably everything seems to go with
you! I am very glad for you both."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Eva. "We might make
a triple wedding of it if your father would
only consent."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I don't wish it. Father is right,
I know; he always is; and I don't want to
leave him yet for anybody."</p>

<p>"And you are entirely right in that, my
dear," said Grandma Elsie. "I can see that,
although I should dearly love to gain possession
of my new little daughter at once."</p>

<p>"It is very nice and kind in you, Grandma
Elsie, to be so ready to claim me for your own,"
Grace returned, happy tears shining in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Ah, I fear your father might see that in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
different light," returned Grandma Elsie, with
one of her sweet smiles. "I think he would
prefer to keep you all his own, and I cannot
blame him. Now, girls," turning to the
others, "suppose we make out a list of the
relatives and friends who should be invited to
your wedding, so that that matter can be
promptly attended to."</p>

<p>The girls gave a ready assent and the list was
presently prepared.</p>

<p>"Now I have been thinking," Eva said, as
they finished, "that as October is so delightful
a month, even up here on the Hudson, we
might as well take a little more time for our
preparations, spending it at Crag Cottage; and
that would make it possible for our friends to
attend the ceremony, should they choose to
come. You could spare that much more time
from your home, couldn't you, Grandma
Elsie?"</p>

<p>"Easily; and I think it a very good idea. If
anything like the entire number of our friends
should come, you would not have sleeping accommodations
for nearly all of them, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
hotels in the neighborhood are, I think, closed,
or will be by that time; but a noon wedding
would enable guests to come in the morning
and leave before night."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's a capital idea, Grandma Elsie!"
exclaimed Lucilla. "Don't you think so,
Eva?"</p>

<p>"I do, and think every one else will," returned
Evelyn joyously. "Then our wedding
gifts can be shown at the cottage, packed, and
sent home afterward in time to get there before
we do&mdash;as we are to take a trip to Niagara
Falls before going home."</p>

<p>When the shoppers returned and were told
of this plan, they one and all highly approved;
so it was decided upon, and the necessary
preparations were promptly made.</p>

<p>The children were in high spirits, delighted
with the purchases they had made; the older
people seemed equally satisfied with theirs,
though their report was given in quieter
fashion. Some of the smaller gifts the purchasers
brought with them, but the others
were to be sent first to Crag Cottage, and after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the wedding from there to the brides' homes.
After some little discussion of the plan, an immediate
return to Crag Cottage was decided
upon, and presently the yacht was steaming
up the river.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a pleasant, happy party that gathered
round the breakfast table at Crag Cottage
the next morning, and a bountiful and excellent
meal which they found spread before
them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Elsie Leland&mdash;acting mistress of the
house for the present&mdash;was highly pleased with
the new arrangements planned for the double
wedding.</p>

<p>"The extension of the time allotted for the
preparations would make it much easier to
carry them out," she said, "while invited
guests would have more time for the carrying
out of theirs; though I doubt if many of
them would think it paid to take so long and
expensive a journey even to see that interesting
sight&mdash;a double wedding."</p>

<p>"I dare say not," said her husband. "Chester,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
do you expect your brother and sisters to
be here?"</p>

<p>"Hardly; the time being so short and the
journey so long. And Frank, I hear, has
found a ladylove down there&mdash;which will be
likely to keep him away. Each of my sisters,
as you probably know, has a young child,&mdash;Maud,
indeed, has two, Sidney one,&mdash;and they
would probably want neither to bring them
along nor leave them behind."</p>

<p>"No, I suppose they will hardly want to
journey so far for a short visit, and will think
it too late in the season for a long one," remarked
Grandma Elsie.</p>

<p>"Yes; I fear that will keep Uncle Horace
and Aunt Rose from joining us, though they
are no farther away than Philadelphia," said
Chester.</p>

<p>"And, as Grandpa sometimes says, they
are now not so young as they once were," said
Mrs. Leland. "We would be delighted to have
them with us, but can scarcely hope for it."</p>

<p>"No," said Violet, "and most of our relatives
and friends, having had their summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
outings, returned home, and settled down
again, can hardly be expected to start out
on so long a journey for so short a bit of entertainment."</p>

<p>"Especially as there are a number of somebodies
getting married every day," laughed
Lucilla.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Harold, with a smile, "it is a
very common occurrence."</p>

<p>The two weeks passed quickly and happily
away, the older ones attending to necessary
preparations, the younger filling up much of
the time with pleasant little excursions up and
down the river in the yacht, or walks, rides,
and drives on land.</p>

<p>The wedding presents began to come in.
The captain's principal gift they knew was
their joint home on his estate, Woodburn, but
there were a number of minor ones&mdash;in the
way of silver for their tables, Sèvres china,
and napery, cut-glass and bric-a-brac. The
gifts of Elsie and Ned consisted of similar
articles. Gracie's gift, chosen by her father
and "Mamma Vi," was a gold bracelet for each,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
ornamented with precious stones. Each
lover had visited Tiffany's and bought for his
bride a very handsome ornament called a sunburst&mdash;a
star of diamonds to be worn as locket
or brooch. They were presented on the morning
of the wedding, and the girls were delighted
with them, as they were with Harold's gift&mdash;a
very beautiful opal ring to each.</p>

<p>It was nearing ten o'clock the night before
the wedding, and Captain Raymond was taking
his usual stroll back and forth upon the
porch before retiring, when Lucilla came to
him for the usual bit of good-night chat so
pleasant to them both. He put his arm about
her and held her close to his heart, as he had
so often done before. For a moment neither
spoke, then she said sobbingly: "Oh, father,
my dear father, this is the last time! How can
I bear it! oh, how can I bear it! how can I
leave you, even for Chester, whom I do love
dearly."</p>

<p>"No, dear child," he said in tones tremulous
with emotion, "it need not be the last
time. We shall be near enough to see and embrace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
each other very often while God spares
our lives; and we will not love each other less
because we are not living all the time under
the same roof."</p>

<p>"No, papa, no, indeed! Oh, I could never
bear it if it wasn't for knowing that! You
have been such a good, kind, wise, and loving
father to me. Oh, I wish I had always been
the good, obedient biddable child I ought to
have been."</p>

<p>"Yes, daughter dear, I know it; I know you
do; while I often wish I had been more patient
and gentle&mdash;less stern with you. But let us
forgive and forget, and each try in the future
to be all to the other that could be desired.
My own dear, dear child! 'The Lord bless
thee: the Lord make his face shine upon thee,
and be gracious unto thee: the Lord lift up his
countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.'"</p>

<p>"Thank you, my dear, dear father," she
said. "That is such a sweet blessing, and I
do so love to hear it from your lips. Oh, I
can never be thankful enough that I have a
Christian father!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nor I for the good hope that my dear
eldest daughter is a true servant, with me, of
the same blessed Master. Now let us say good-night,
for it is time you were preparing for
your rest."</p>

<p>Most of the invited guests except a few who
would arrive in the morning had come, but, by
sending the young gentlemen and lads to sleep
in the yacht, room had been made for all.</p>

<p>The ceremony took place the next day at
high noon&mdash;the brides, the gifts, the house
bedecked with flowers, all looking very lovely.
A grand wedding breakfast followed, then
bridal dresses were exchanged for travelling
suits, handsome and becoming, and the newly
married couples, accompanied by Grace and
Harold, went aboard the <i>Dolphin</i>, which carried
them to the city, where they would take
the cars for Niagara. Harold and Grace saw
them on the train, waved them good-bye as it
started, then returned on the yacht to Crag
Cottage.</p>

<p>A few days later the <i>Dolphin</i> was again
speeding southward, carrying her owner and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
his family&mdash;including Mrs. Travilla and her
son Harold, also the Lelands, to their homes.
They had a delightful voyage, and arrived at
their destination in fine health and spirits.
But that was not the last trip made by the
yacht for that season; within a fortnight she
was again steaming up the Hudson, and in the
harbor of the city where the bridal party had
left her they found her lying at anchor one
day, when the train bearing them on their return
from the west came rushing into the
station.</p>

<p>"Oh, it really seems something like getting
home!" Lucilla exclaimed as she stepped upon
the deck. "But father did not come!" she
added, with a slight sigh of disappointment,
glancing about in the vain hope of catching
sight of the manly form and face she loved so
well.</p>

<p>"No, Mrs. Dinsmore, but you'll be sure to
get sight of the captain when you reach the
other end of the voyage," said Mr. Bailey,
temporary skipper, coming forward with a
bow and smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>"And the voyage will be but a short one if
the weather continues good," remarked Max,
offering a hand to Bailey in cordial greeting,
then introducing his bride.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bailey, taking in his the hand
she offered, and looking at her with admiring
eyes, "I used to know her pretty well as Miss
Leland. I wish you both a great deal of happiness
and prosperity. And you and your
bride the same, Mr. Dinsmore," shaking hands
with Chester in his turn. "I think, ladies and
gentlemen, you will find everything shipshape
in the saloon and staterooms; the captain was
very particular about all that."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Evelyn, "and now that we are
here on the dear old yacht I feel that the discomforts
of travel by rail are happily gotten
rid of; everything is so clean, quiet, and homelike
here."</p>

<p>"I think it is delightful," said Lucilla;
"only I am disappointed that father did not
come."</p>

<p>"No doubt it was having too many other
things to attend to that prevented him," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Max. "And doubtless he will meet us at the
wharf when we land."</p>

<p>The weather was all that could be desired,
the yacht in fine condition, and in due time
they anchored in the harbor of their own city,
and presently landed, to find a number of the
dear ones waiting for them. Captain Raymond
was there with his entire family, and
Lucilla had scarcely stepped ashore ere she
found herself in his arms, his kiss of fatherly
love upon her lips.</p>

<p>"How glad I am to have you here again, my
darling," he said in tender tones. "I hope
you have enjoyed your trip, and come back to
me feeling well and strong?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, father dear, yes indeed! and so, so
glad to be with you again! I could never,
never live without my father."</p>

<p>"That is pretty much as I feel about my
eldest daughter," he returned with a smile,
and repeating his caresses.</p>

<p>Then Eva must take her turn, and the son
and son-in-law each received a cordial grasp
and shake of the hand. Then joyous greetings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
were exchanged with the Lelands, Violet,
Elsie, and Ned. The Woodburn and Fairview
carriages were there, and nearby stood another&mdash;a
two-seated, very handsome vehicle, with a
pair of fine, spirited-looking grays attached.
Greetings over, the captain led the way to the
equipage, and turning with a kind, fatherly
smile toward the bridal party, "Here, my children,"
he said, "is a gift from your father to
be held and used&mdash;enjoyed, too, I trust&mdash;by the
four of you in common."</p>

<p>"Father, I'm afraid you are doing too much
for us!" exclaimed Max, with emotion.</p>

<p>"A grand good gift, sir, for which I heartily
thank you," said Chester warmly.</p>

<p>"Dear father, don't ruin yourself by heaping
so many, many gifts upon us," cried Lucilla,
turning, and putting her hand in his,
while Evelyn said, with starting tears "that it
was really too much."</p>

<p>"No, I am perfectly able to afford it, my
dears, and shall be very glad if it adds to your
enjoyment of your new home," said the generous
giver. "Get in now, drive over to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
new home, and see if everything about house
and grounds has been arranged to suit your
taste."</p>

<p>They obeyed, and found the carriage, as they
afterward said, the easiest, most comfortable
one they had ever ridden in, and the horses
the finest of thoroughbreds.</p>

<p>"These are grand fellows, Max; I'll warrant
your father has spent no trifle on their purchase,"
remarked Chester as they sped onward
with easy, graceful motion.</p>

<p>"Just what I think," said Max. "No more
generous man than he ever lived."</p>

<p>"I only hope he won't ruin himself by heaping
expensive gifts and favors upon us," said
Evelyn.</p>

<p>"I hope not, indeed!" sighed Lucilla, with
a slight tremble in her tones.</p>

<p>"Don't be anxious and troubled about it,
sister mine," said Max very kindly. "I happen
to know that father has abundant means.
And being so generous of nature it is a delight
to him to give&mdash;especially to his wife and
children."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a dear, good father he is! It is just
a delight to me that I may call him that now,"
said Evelyn.</p>

<p>Their carriage reached its destination some
minutes ahead of the captain's, and they immediately
alighted and gazed about them with
wondering and delighted eyes&mdash;so many improvements
had been made since last they saw
the place, trees and flowers, lovely and fragrant,
having been transplanted from other
places to adorn this. They wandered here
and there, expressing in looks and joyous
exclamations admiration, gratitude, and delight.</p>

<p>They had hardly made acquaintance with all
the beauties of the place when the other carriage
drove up and the rest of the family joined
them. Then, as the captain afterward said,
they well-nigh overwhelmed him with the extravagant
outpouring of their admiration,
gratitude, and delight.</p>

<p>"I am very glad that you are all so well
pleased," he said, in return. "My wife and I
have greatly enjoyed this labor of love,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
overseeing and directing of these improvements,&mdash;and
that they find such favor with
you all more than repays us. But, come, let us
go inside and see how well you are satisfied with
things there."</p>
